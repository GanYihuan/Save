<font color="ffff00">片 名 : 闪 电 狗</font>
谢谢 这可真是个好消息
Thank you. Which that of course is wonderful news.

一切都已经就位
Everything is positioning nicely.

就是他 卡利科博士!
There he is, doctor Calico!

有没有运气能激发我们客人的勇气?
Any luck getting our guest to spill his guts?

噢 会激发出他的勇气来的
Oh, his guts will spill.

看用什么办法了
One way or another.

不 我绝不会说的
Never, I'll never talk.

爸爸!
Daddy!

你是在激怒我 教授 我很生气
You're beginning to urge me profesor, I'm urged.

但这无济于事 一旦包裹到达...
And that will not do. As the package arrived...

我想我们亲爱的朋友 会更容易沟通...
...I think it might make our dear friend a bit more communicative.

我正派人去把它取来
I'm sending an agent to pick it up.

太好了 让他做头班飞机带给我
Gorgeous! Have him bring it to me on the first flight.

Bolt 出发!
Bolt, let's go!

我们只要那女孩!
We only need the girl!

- 什么? - 卡利科在哪?
- What? - Where is Calico?

我才不会告诉你呢
I'm not talking to you.

玻利维亚 玻利维亚 卡利科在玻利维亚!
Bolivia, Bolivia, Calico is in Bolivia!

靠近罗加瓜多湖
Near lake Rogaguado!

罗加瓜多湖? 我早该想到的
Lake Rogaguado? I should have known!

来吧 Bolt 我们走
Come on Bolt, let's go.

玻利维亚 10分钟后有一班飞机去那儿
Bolivia, there is a flight leaving in 10 minutes.

Bolt 急速移动!
Bolt, zoom zoom!

Bolt 去取回来
Bolt, prinde.

小狗狗!
Puppy!

锁定
LOCK

好样的!
Good boy!

去机场!
Airport!

Bolt 狮子吼
Bolt, speak.

好了
Okay, okay...

干得漂亮 伙计
Good job, buddy.

任务完成!
Mission accomplished!

那是个守卫
That's a keeper!

没事了 硬汉 你把他们都抓住了
It's allright tough guy, you caught them all.

没事啦 Bolt 你又一次拯救了世界
Don't worry Bolt, you've saved the day again.

好孩子!
Good boy!

去机场!
Airport!

Bolt 狮子吼
Bolt, speak.

麦克风吊杆!
Boom mike!

- 有一个传声器架 - 是个传声器架
- We got a boom mike. - That's a boom mike.

真糟糕
That's sloppy.

狗会看见这个的 他可能已经看见了!
The dog could've seen that. He could've seen that!

就算是狗看到了又怎样?
Uh, who cares if the dog sees a boom mike?

请允许我先问一句...
Forgive me for answering a question with a question,...

你又是谁?
...but who are you?

联播网的明迪·帕克
Mindy Parker, from the network.

当然 我来问你 联播网的明迪·帕克
Of course. Let me ask you, Mindy from the network...

你从这里看到了什么?
What do you see here?

- 呃 小狗? - 她说"小狗"
- Uhh... the dog? - "The dog" she says.

噢 明迪 可怜的明迪
Oh, Mindy. Poor, poor Mindy.

我说错什么了么?
Am I missing something?

你大错特错了 明迪
You're missing everything, Mindy.

你看见的是一只狗 我看见的是这样一个动物
You see a dog. I see an animal that believes...

他全心全意相信
...with every fiber of his being, every fiber...

他爱的女孩处在最危险的关头
...that the girl he loves is in mortal danger.

狗的表情里流露出的深沉情感
I see a depth of emotion on the face of that canine the likes of which...

此前从未在荧幕上出现过
...has never been captured on screen before.

从未啊 联播网的明迪
Never, Mindy from the network.

我们就是要让他相信 这一切都是真实的
We jump through hoops to make sure Bolt believes everything is real.

这就是为什么 我们不用场记 不重拍
It's why we don't miss marks. It's why we don't reshoot.

这就是为什么我们绝不 让狗看到传声器架
And it's why we most certainly do not let the dog see boom mikes!

因为 联播网的明迪
Because, Mindy from the network,...

只有那狗相信...
...if the dog believes it,...

观众们才会相信
...the audience believes it.

好吧 你想要现实就给你现实
Wow. Okay, you want reality, here you go chief.

这个剧情太老套了
The show's too predictable.

女孩有危险 小狗从可怕的英国佬 手里救下她 我们都知道
The girl's in danger, the dog saves her from the creepy english guy, we get it.

总是个大团圆的结局
There's always a happy ending.

我们的调查小组称 18到35岁的成人并不满意
And our focus groups tell us 18 to 35 year olds are unhappy.

他们不喜欢皆大欢喜的结局
They're not happy with happy.

或许你可以...
So maybe you should, I don't know,...

少花点时间担心小狗的行动方式
...spend a little less time worrying about the dog's method acting,...

而多花点时间想想
...and more time figuring out how to stop 20 year olds in Topeka...

如何阻止20岁的人换频道
...from changing the channel.

要是收视率下降半个点...
Because if you lose so much as half a rating point,...

我发誓 把你们都炒了 就从你开始!
...so help me, I will fire everyone in this room, starting with you!

这个够现实吧
How's that for real?

贴这里 很好
There. Perfect.

你又一次救了我 Bolt
You saved me again, Bolt.

好了 没什么的
It's okay, it's nothing.

没有坏人了
No more bad guys.

你要吃东西么 你饿不饿?
Do you want some food, Bolty? Huh? Are you hungry?

你把他们都逮住了 Bolt 没人能伤害我了
You've got them, Bolt, no one is gonna hurt me.

Bolt 看看我 我没事的 看到没?
Bolt, look at me. I'm fine, see?

到这来 伙计 到这来!
Come here buddy, come here!

去 捡回来 Bolt 去呀
Go, get it Bolt! Go, get it!

这个也不好玩了
Yeah, that one is no funny either.

看哪 我们找到什么了?
Well, what we have here?

你的老朋友 胡萝卜先生!
Your old buddy, Mister Carrot!

噢 Bolt!
Oh, Bolt!

我得走了
You know I have to go.

真是我的好孩子
Yeah, you are my good boy.

在这里啊 我的超级明星
And there she is, my little superstar!

我们来为"青少年"杂志 拍张封面照吧
Let's get to that "Teen" vogue cover shoot.

妈妈 我想带Bolt回家度周末
Mam, I wanna take Bolt home for this weekend.

- 这个...我... - 噢 这很好
- Well, I... I'm... - Oh, that be nice. That be great.

会很不错的 小女孩和她的狗
That would. A little girl and her dog.

再好不过了
Nothing better that.

这么说 我能带Bolt回家了?
So I can bring Bolt home?

作为你的朋友 我会说是的 当然可以
As your friend, I say yes, absolutely...

但是作为你的经纪人 我得提醒你 对Bolt的规则是
...but as your agent, I have to remind you. This is Bolt's law.

他必须留在这里
He has to stay right here.

好了 我们走
Okay, let's go.

但他从没有过过真正的生活
But he never gets to be a real dog.

就一次 这周末带他回家
And it will be only for the weekend and I just once...

什么 知道吗 这问题很公平 这么着吧 比方说拿出来个别针
What? You know what? It's a fair question. Let's do this, let's put a pin in it.

别在这 这样就行了 现在让我们先放一放吧
Pin in, there you go. Now, let's let that hang there a little bit...

等想通了我们再来讨论 好么?
...and then we'll address that when we thought things through, okay?

大家觉得怎么样? 都笑一笑!
Good enough for everybody? Smiles all around!

我们走吧 快点
Let's get out of here. Come on.

我不想想那么多 我想带Bolt回家
I don't need to think it through. I wanna take Bolt home.

瞧瞧你可爱的小脸 我家里也有个小女儿
Look at this face! I have a little girl at home,...

我毕生的爱 我愿意为她做任何事
...love of my life. I would do anything for her.

但我还是会心跳不已地拿她和你换!
And I would trade her for you in a heartbeat!

真的
True story.

这提醒我 这就得重新做衣柜了
That reminds me, uh, we need to begin over to wardrobe.

我们走吧
Let's go.

- 我需要... - 我...我只是...
- I need every... - I... I just...

这么说 小狗认为这全都是真的?
So, the dog thinks this is all real?

是啊 新鲜吧 这家伙从没离开过片场
Oh, yeah. Hear new. Guy never leaves the set.

难以置信 等有机会 我就把这个公布出来
It's unbelievable. Whenever I get a chance this is the perfect way to unwind.

就用邪恶的大笑来开始
I like to start with an evil laugh.

嘿 小毛球!
Hello, hairballs!

或许今天你赢了 Bolt 但最终
You may have one today Bolt, but in the end...

我们还是会抓到你的小Penny
...we will get your little Penny.

不见得 小猫 既然你选择了邪恶之路
Not likely cat. For you've choosen to follow the path of evil,...

到头来我们会摧毁你 还有你邪恶的傀儡主人
...ultimately we'll destroy you, along with your fiendish puppet master.

- 喔! - 我知道 看看这个
- Wow! - I know. Okay, watch this.

她要完蛋了 小狗 绿眼人已经制定了计划
She is a goner, dog. But green-eyed man has a plan...

很快就会付诸实施的
...and soon he will execute it.

然后他会干掉她的!
Yeah and then he will execute her!

说的不错!
Nice!

我本可以用狮子吼来 让你们两个滚蛋
I would super bark you both back into the hole you crawled out of...

但我需要你活着
...but I need you alive...

因为我要你给绿眼人捎个信儿
...because I got a little message for you to take back to your green-eyed man.

告诉他 他的老朋友Bolt说他...
You tell him, his old friend Bolt said he...

这很长么?
Is it long?

- 什么长不长? - 要带的口信
- Is what long? - The message.

那口信很长么? 我的记性不好
Is it a long message? Because I have a horrible memory.

长话短说 好了吧 你告诉他说 我要...
Yeah, I'll make a brief, all right? You tell him I said, I'm gonna...

干脆我们这么着吧
You know what? Why don't we do this?

你来记前一半 我来记后面的部分
You remember the first half of the message and then I remember the second.

然后我们拼在一起 就可以把它带绿眼人了
And then we can pass it on green-eyed man together.

我不管你们怎么把话带到
I don't care how the message is translated, alright?

只要带到就行 告诉绿眼人 我不会轻易罢手的
Just do it, okay? Tell the green-eyed man, that I will not sleep,...

不将Penny救出来 我绝不善罢甘休
...I will not rest until my Penny is safe from his evil clutches.

你告诉绿眼人 我会...
You tell the green-eyed man, I'll...

字数太多了 像什么"什么?""呼?"...
Way too many words! I was like, "what?", and then I was like "huh?"...

还有什么"我有点无聊" 还有些跟爪子有关系?
...and then "I got a little bored". Some about clutches?

无论如何 我尽力吧 再见
Anyway, I'll do my best! Ciao!

顺便说 粉丝很多 都喜欢这个 喜欢你 得走了 谢谢
By the way, huge fan, love it, love you, gotta go. Thank you!

给我回来 你这坏蛋 讨厌又下贱
Get back here, you... You sick! Revolting, low some little...

你父亲的发现 对我们组织极为重要
Your father's discoveries could be a great use to our organization.

等我抓到了"幸运的Penny"后
I'm sure, he will be more commutating...

他会更加合作一些!
...now that I've got his "lucky Penny"!

Bolt!
Bolt!

世界将由我掌握!
World domination is waiting my grasp!

调查小组对这个结尾怎么看?
How did you focus groups feel about the end of this?

你要迎合18到35岁的观众群
You asked for unhappy 18 to 35 years old,...

我就给他们一个悲剧的结局
...I give you unhappy 18 to 35 year olds.

Bolt 没事的 Bolt 我很好
Bolt, it's okay Bolt. I'm fine.

守卫 拦住她
Guards, stop her!

- 嘿 嘿! - Bolt!
- Hey, hey! - Bolt!

- 停下来! - 听听他的叫声
- Hold on! - Listen to him.

- 他需要知道我没事 - 不 你有事
- He needs to know I'm okay. - No, you're not okay.

你已经被恶魔般的卡利科博士绑架
You've been kidnapped by fiendish Doctor Calico.

至少我们要那只小狗这么想...
At least that is what the dog needs to think but...

想一想吧 等他明天营救了你后
...just imagine, close your eyes and imagine how excited he'll be...

他该多兴奋
...when he saves you, tomorrow. OK?

但他整晚都会担心的 求你了 让我...
But he's gonna be freaking out all night. Please, just let me...

等一下 你耳朵后面是什么东西?
Wait a second. What's that behind your ear?

是个...对了 是个别针!
Is that a... Yes, it is! It's a pin!

这么着吧 先把这次谈话别起来
Let's do this. Let's take the pin and put it in this conversation.

但不是完全搁下不管 不是的 直到这件事情解决
And we will not take it down, no m'am, until this matter is resolved.

- 但我只是... - 我记得有件什么事来着?
- But I just... - What's that reminds me up?

DVD发售会赶紧出发吧 那可是很大的活动
The DVD release junket. Let's get going. It's a big push.

我想打扮时髦的去参加发售会
I want to go with a modern looks.

好了 给她点空间吧 别挤着我们的天才了
Allright, okay. Let's give her some air. Let's not crowd the talent.

我一直在练习这种邪恶的笑 有没有一种邪恶的笑
I've been working on my evil laugh. Is there an evil laugh like...

像这样的
With that.

好了 是这么回事 你还不会邪恶的笑
Okay, here is the thing. You're not ready for the evil laugh.

你可以在我邪恶笑之后 吃吃的轻笑几声
You could do a chuckle, like a mildly upset chuckle...

像是让人心烦的吃吃笑 听我的
...after my evil laugh. Listen to mine.

肯定是绿眼人谋划的!
This is a "green-eyed man" written all of it!

你们有没有见到一个绿眼睛的人?
Have you seen a man with a green eye?

我得说两句 要是可以的话

It was a slow week. I mean, that's half of what I got.

你听到了么 路易 我都快饿死了
You hear this, Louie? I'm starving here.

要是我的胃开始说话 它就不是跟我说了
And when the old stomach starts talking, it's not talking to me.

- 而是跟我的爪子说 - 别举爪子 求求你!
- It's talking to... the claws! - Not the claws! Please!

我在努力控制这些坏家伙 但事情也不是全取决于我
I'm holding these bad boys back as best as I can, but the thing is it's not up to me.

胃和爪子之间有一条直线...
The stomach got a direct line to these babies,...

而且都在对我喋喋不休呢
...and I'm picking up a lot of chatter!

要我和爪子谈的话 作为交换
So, I'll talk to the claws, but in exchange...

- 下周 你要交出所有的食物 - 可是我们有约在先的!
...next week, all your food comes to me. - But that's not our deal!

我给你一半 你保护我 我们说好的

Okay, okay! Look buddy, I don't know what you're getting at, but...

说吧 米滕 告诉这家伙她在哪
Come on, Mittens. Just tell the guy where she is.

- 告诉这小狗 别惹他不高兴 - 对啊 说吧 告诉他

乔伊 文尼 鲍比 我的好孩子!
Joey, Vinnie, Bobby, my boys!

Would you tell the crazy canine that he's got the wrong cat?

- 你找到她了 伙计! - 就是她!
- You got her, pal! - That's her!

- 就是你要找的那只猫! - 绝对是!
- She's the one! - That is definitely the right cat!

看来非得用狠招了
Looks like we're gonna do this the hard way.

Whoa! Aaah! You're crazy, man!

乔伊 我们是不是有点过分了?
Hey Joey, do we go too far on this?

开什么玩笑 这是我生命中最好的一天
You kidding? This is the best day in my life.

你为本和巴特工作 他们是绿眼人的手下
You work for Ben and Bart, who work with the man green-eye.

他们带走了Penny 她现在在哪?
They take him Penny. Where is she?

- 我不知道你在说什么 - 这让人有点累了...
- I don't know what you're talking about. - This is becoming tiring so cat...

事实上 我正想打一个哈欠
...in fact, I feel a yawn coming on.

好吧 好吧 我说 我全说 我知道Penny在哪
Okay, okay, I'll talk, I'll talk. I know where Penny is.

没错 他们抓住了她
Yeah, they have her.

那个蓝眼睛的黑衣人
Yes, the men in black and the guy, the guy with the blue eyes.

蓝眼睛?
Blue eyes?

哦 绿眼睛 那个绿眼睛的人
Oh, green! Yes, green! The one green eye.

你还在撒谎 天生的谎言家 真让人讨厌
You just can't stop lying, can you cat? It's in the genes. This is gross.

我知道 这很讨厌 我也讨厌我自己
I know, it's disgusting, I disgust myself.

好莱坞?
Hollywood?

你放我下来 我就告诉你她在哪
But if you put me down, I'll show you where she is.

松饼之家
瞧 你得明白 我这可是冒风险的
You know, I hope you appreciate the risk I'm taking here.

我邪恶身体的每一根骨头 都在告诉我
Every bone in my evil cat body is telling me...

不要背叛绿眼人
...not to betray the trust of the green-eyed man.

好了 这是全世界
Okay, this is a top, top secret map...

最最机密的地图!
...of the entire earth!

现在 我们是在这里 举着大火炬的绿女士旁边
Now, we're over here, by the green lady with the big torch.

而我的老板把Penny关在...
And my boss has Penny locked up...

就在...就在这里 这个戴太阳镜的饼干这里!
Right, right over... Here, here! By the waffle with the sun glasses!

你现在只需要从这里去到那里
Now all you need to do is get from here to there.

好了 我告诉你去哪找他 你放开我 我马上闪人
Well, I told you where you find her, so if you'll just untie me, I'll be on my way.

找到Penny就放了你
I'll release you cat, when we found Penny.

什么 不是这样的 我们有约在先的
Excuse me? That wasn't the deal! We had a deal!

你的协议刚刚过期
Your deal just expired.

十分钟前 她也是这么跟我说的
She said that to me, not 10 minutes ago.

真讽刺!
The irony!

太好了
Perfect.

嗯 锁上了
Hmm... padlock.

听着 疯狗(Cujo电影名 又名凶狗古卓) 我的手掌下面藏着邪恶的利爪...
Listen Cujo, I got some pretty wicked claws under these mitts,...

别逼我把它们亮出来!
...do not, I beg of you do not make me bring out these bad boys!

会很吓人的!
It gets ugly!

- 你在干什么? - 待在后面!

Grave danger. I know. But I've captured this cat.

我猜她是绿眼人的奸细!
An agent of the green-eyed man, I presume!

你猜的没错 她正要带我去找Penny
You presumed correctly. She is taking me to Penny.

你! 你真是一个 十恶不赦的坏蛋
You! You are a vile vermin.

你晚上怎么睡得着? Penny是世界上最最好的人
How did you sleep at night? Penny is the most wonderful person ever.

她喜欢闪电狗 闪电狗棒极了 你却是如此邪恶!
She loves Bolt and he is awesome. And you're a monster!

你怎么敢用你的邪恶来破坏 他们的关系!
How dare you destruct their relationship with your evil!

- 去死吧!去死吧! - 噢!噢!
- Die! Die! - Ow! Ow!

让我来把她灭掉 闪电狗
I can take her Bolty.

- 去死吧!去死吧! - 别激动 别激动 犀牛

- 我把危险当早餐 - 你现在饿了吗?
- I eat danger for breakfast. - You're hungry?

- 我简直要饿死啦 - 那么欢迎加入我们
- Starving. - Welcome aboard.

嘿 我们能谈一谈么?
Hey, can we talk for a second?

我不懂这是咋回事 我只想知道...
I don't know what's going on here but I'm just a little bit concerned...

...这一路上还会 遇上多少神经病
...about the numbers of lunatics on this trip.

- 我的极限是一个 - 他和我们一起去
- My limit is one. - He is coming with us.

但我...
But I...

快走 犯人! 天马上就要黑啦
Move it prisoner, we're losing daylight.

说得对
I agree.

现在 我们需要找到 最好的交通工具
Now, we need to find the best set of wheels.

我有一个好主意 跟我来!
I've got a better idea. Follow me!

好吧 我们要做的 就是迅速跃到目标上
Okay. So we do here is we get the target with a quick fly over.

只要做一个抛物线运动 还有什么要补充的吗 犀牛?
We just the trajectory in the land dead center. Am I missing anything, Rhino?

和你在一起的 每一分钟都会变成...
Just the knowledge that every minute spent in your company becomes...

...我生命里最美好的时光!
...the new greatest minute of my life!

不 不要! 你们这俩疯子 我才不跳呢
No, forget it! How do you say, "No way I'm doing this" in crazy?

- 镇定 小猫 我罩着你呢 - 那才令人担心呢

Get down here cat. We don't have time for this.

Look, genius. You're a part of a TV show.
你知道吗 天才 你是电视节目的演员
你知道吗?电视机 那是人用来娱乐的工具
You know what that is? Television. It's an entertainment for people.

那是假的! 你想的都是假的!
It's fake! Nothing you think is real as real!

胡说八道!
That's has preposterous!

Bolt 你想一想 你走失之后 你的超能力都失效了 不是么?
Think about it Bolt. Since you got lost, none of your powers are working, aren't they?

你变得会流血了 会感到饥饿了 我说...
你还以为你天生就具有 超能力 和一个闪电纹身吗?
那是我力量的象征 小猫
那是化妆师弄上去的 小狗
太可笑了! 下来!
Get down here!

Mittens 你再不听话 我就用狮子吼轰你下来
Mittens, so help me, I will super bark you out of that tree.

在我小时候 我想要 一辆自行车做生日礼物...

...但是我的父母给了 我一个棒球手套 所以...
...but my parents got me a baseball glove. So...

你知道我是怎么做的吗? 我就当那手套是自行车

我每天都骑着它去学校
And I rode it to school every day.

是真实的故事哦
True story.

- 那不是他 - 我觉得是 真的
- It's not him. - I think it's him. I do.

谢谢
Thank you.

小朋友 我们开门见山吧
Look kid, it's time we are honest with you.

如果我们不恢复拍摄 就会有很多人失业
If we don't get back in the production, people are gonna lose their jobs.

- 他们都是好人 - 可Bolt还没回来
- Good people with families. - But Bolt is still out there.

- 我... - 我知道 我们知道你的感受
- And I... - I know, we feel for you.

现在你该长大了
And the last thing we wanna do is ask a little girl to make a grown up decision.

事已成定局 你不该在深陷其中了
But it's come to that, we need you to move on.

我们要你忘了Bolt
We need you to let Bolt go.

都是泡沫塑料惹的祸!
It must be made of styrofoam!

不 不! 不能这样就完了!
No, no! No, no, no! Please, it can't end like this!

小猫 别担心啦 我来想办法
Stop worrying cat. I'll get us out of here.

你不行的 Bolt 你什么都不行
You can't, Bolt. You got nothing.

你没有超能力 也没有狮子吼
No super strength, no super bark.

也没有激光视线
And no heat vision.

听我说好不好? 我们正被带到一个地方...
Listen to me, okay? We've been taking to a place...

...人们去那里挑选宠物 明白么?
...where humans go animal shopping, alright?

人们总是选那些可爱的
And this is what humans do. They always pick the cute ones.

那些长得和你差不多的 Bolt
The ones that look like you, Bolt.

而像我们这种就老死在里面了
But the rest of us never come back out.

我说了 我会想出办法的 明白么?
I said, I'll get us out of here, alright?

我的英雄!
My hero!

叮铃铃 叮铃铃 你是谁? 是命运!
Ring, ring. Who is it? Destiny!

我一直在等你的电话
I've been expecting your call.

哦 你还没有放弃么? 你会把脑浆撞出来的
Oh, you didn't given up already? You'll liquefy whatever brains you have left.

任何容器都限制不了我!
I can not be contained in any container.

你这个逃兵!看看这个!
You quitter! Watch this!

我做到了! 我又厉害了!
I did it! I'm back!

那个泡沫塑料真是个邪恶的东西
That styrofoam is a wicked stuff.

简直太帅啦!任何卡车都 关不住Bolt和犀牛!
Totally awesome! There is no truck that I know that can keep Bolt and Rhino!

犀牛 你怎么会在这里?
Rhino, what are you doing here?

哦 没什么 那时我正在 尝试散步新方法...
Oh, nothing. I was enjoying a new thing stroll...

...然后我就把卡车上 笼子的门撞得当当响!
...and then I just pop the hatch on hack the containment unit!

- 你...你开了门? - 是的 是我开的
- You... You open the door? - Yes, I did.

那...那真是太棒了 犀牛
That's... That's great, Rhino.

是啊 那...那太棒了
Yeah, that's... That's really good.

好吧 我们现在去救犯人
Alright, let's go get the prisoner back.

我...我不行的
I... I can't do it.

你说什么?
What did you say?

- 我做不到 - 什么...你是谁?
- I can't. - What... Who are you?

犀牛 你太... 你只是有点...
Rhino, you're just... Just a little...

- 你是闪电狗 - 但是我不是...

是谁单枪匹马摧毁了 绿眼人的海底实验室?
Who single handedly destroyed the green-eyed man's under sea labs?

那是谁使他机器人 奥运会计划死于襁褓?
And who foiled his plan to infiltrate the Olympics with nastic cyborgs?

- 是谁 是闪电狗啊!是谁呢? - 是我 但没有一次是...

是你!你能行的 Bolt 因为 在这个地球上...
You! You can, Bolt. Because, all over this planet...

...还有很多动物想做却做不到
...there are animals who feel like they can't.

就好像一个小仓鼠 他曾经在旅游车里生活
Like a little hamster, who once spend his days in a RV park.

他梦想着有一天也能 救一个小女孩 然后听她说:
Dreaming of the day when he too would save a little girl from danger and be told:

"你做到了! 犀牛! 是你救了我!"
"You did it! You did it, Rhino! You saved the day."

他们需要的是一个英雄 闪电狗!
They need a hero, Bolt!

那是一个不畏艰难 勇往直前的英雄
Someone, who never mind what the odds, will do what's right.

他们需要一个英雄来告诉他们 有时不可能的事情...
They need a hero to tell them that sometimes the impossible...

...是可以成为可能的 只要你很棒的话!
...can become possible, if you're awesome!

你有一点说得很对 犀牛
Well, you're right about one thing, Rhino.

Mittens 现在真的需要一个英雄
Mittens does need a hero.

我想我应该挺身而出
I guess I'll have to do.

你是多么谦虚啊! 那么现在 谁要去救那只猫?
Such modesty! Now, who is going to save that cat?

- 我 - 谁?告诉我谁?

我
Me.

我去拿我的球

Don't worry about it. Being a regular dog,...

...是世界上最最开心的事情好不好?
...not like the greatest geek in the world, okay?

我告诉你一个秘密如何?
Look, I'm gonna let you in, on a little secret, okay?

别人都不知道的猫的秘密
Little known cat secret.

知道我们为什么讨厌狗们吗?
You know why we hate dogs?

因为我们想要变成狗啊 我们有恋狗情节
Because we wanna be dogs, we have dog complexes.

但是...狗们都做些什么呢?
But... But what are dogs do?

弄脏东西 睡觉 追自己的尾巴 咬鞋子
Slubber, sleep, chase tails, chew shoes.

这并不需要硕士学位
You don't exactly need a master's degree.

This... This is awesome.

然后把你的舌头伸出来!
And stick your tongue out!

感觉棒极啦! 你为什么不试试呢?
This is totally awesome! Why don't you try it?

不用啦 谢谢 只有狗才这么干
No, thanks. It's really a dog thing.

 我有很多可以给予
I have got so much to give,

 我发誓我有
I swear I do.

 也许我并没有九条命
I may not have nine lives,

 但是这次我感觉到了新生
but this one feels brand new.

Yes I抳e lived a good one.

 我试着过的真实
I have tried to be true.

 有些事情我从未想过
There are some things I never realized,

 直到我遇见你

 风儿吹拂脸颊的滋味
How the wind feels on my cheeks,

 对着月儿狂吠的感觉
when I抦 barking at the moon.

 你的家是如此独一无二
There is no home like the one you抳e got,

 因为那个家属于你

Here I come

 回到你身边

I was so confused.

 亲爱的 我从没看到过彩虹
I may not see in color babe,

 我能感觉到只是忧郁
but I sure can feel blue.

 我经历了很多事
I have been a lot of things,

 也许他们不都是真的
they may not all be true.

 我的经历充满神秘
My experience was so mysterious,

 直到我遇见你
till I met you.

 也许现在旭日东升
Now the sun may rise in the east,

 但我正对着月亮狂吠
but I抦 barking at the moon.

 你的家是如此独一无二
There is no home like the one you抳e got,

 因为这个家属于你

好啦 好啦 不准偷看
Okay, okay, no picking.

Alright. Now, open them.

这是世界上最好的地方 宝贝!
Best in the globe, baby!

让我来介绍一下好吧?
Just let me give you a grand tour, okay?

这个 这个是我的 这个 都是你的
This one, this one is mine. And this one is all yours.

- Mittens 我... - 哦 我把这个超级软枕头给你啦
- Mittens, I... - Oh, I found this really soft pillow thing for you.

知道吗?我找了些 泡沫塑料填在里面
And get this! I found some styrofoam and I stuffed it inside.

这样既有创意 又讽刺 你明白不?
Which I thought both kind of creative and ironic. You know what I mean?

- Mittens 我不认为... - 看这个!
- Mittens, I don't think that... - Check it out!

完全的隐私 百分百的隔音!
Total privacy and completely sound proof!

- 是啊  我不... - 好吧 我吹牛的 这不隔音
- Yeah, well, I don't think that I... - Okay, I lied. It's not sound proof.

- 但是 你知道... - Mittens 我不能呆在这里
- But, you know... - Mittens, I can't stay here.

- 什么? - 我离Penny还有一块饼干那么远
- What? - We're one waffle away from Penny.

你还想回去找她?
You still going back to her?

Mittens 她是我的主人
Mittens, she is my person.

我的耳朵 我的耳朵!
Ouch! Ouch! Ear, ear!

看着我 Bolt 我是真实的
Look at me, Bolt. I'm real.

现在 这个呢? 这是真实的吗?
Now, how about this, huh? Is that real?

你觉得这个很真实么? 那个呢? 那个是真的吗?
Is this look real to you? Or that? Is that real? Or that?

那个怎么样 Bolt? 她只是一个演员而已
How about that, Bolt? She is an actress.

- 她只是在演戏 - Penny才不是
- She is just pretending. - Not Penny.

世界上是没有Penny的 她是假的
There is no Penny. She is fake.

不对 你错了 她很喜欢我
No, you're wrong. She loves me.

不 不 Bolt 那是他们的工作 你懂吗?
No, no Bolt. That's what they do, okay?

他们表现得很喜欢你 表现得他们会永远陪你
They act like they love you. They act like they'll be there forever.

可是突然有一天 他们就收拾东西走人了...
And then one day, they pack up all their stuff and move away,...

...同时他们把对你的爱也带走了
...and take their love with them.

留下他们的猫自生自灭!
And leave their declawed cat behind to fend for herself!

他们抛弃了她...
They leave her...

...她却还在想她到底做错了什么
...wondering what she did wrong.

对不起Mittens 但是...
I'm sorry Mittens, but...

Penny不是这样的
Penny is different.

那就去吧
Then go.

- Mittens 我... - 你滚吧 Bolt!
- Mittens, I... - Get out of here, Bolt!

我一开始就不该可怜你
I never should take a pitty on you.

- 哦 Mittens... - 滚 Bolt!
- Oh, Mittens... - Just get out of here, Bolt!

你要照顾好自己
You take care of Mittens.

小心驾驶 出入平安
那块肉披萨 一点也不好吃!
That meat lover's pizza is not loving me back at all!

- 你好啊 犀牛 - 早安 猫咪
- Hey there, Rhino. - Morning, cat.

- Bolt呢? - 他...呃...
- Where is Bolt? - He is... Uh...

- 他走了 - Bolt走了?
- He's gone. - Bolt left?

是的 但是他...他要我告诉你.
Yeah, but he... Uhm... He instructed me to tell you, that he... Uhm...

他必须独自去面对绿眼人
He had to face the green-eyed man alone.

- 你去哪? - 去找他
- Where are you going? - To Bolt.

但他不再需要我们了
But he doesn't need us anymore.

相信我 我在电视里看过
Trust me, I've seen that a million times before.

在战斗开始前的黑夜里 当坏人的钢牙...
In the cold, dark night before the battle when the steely fangs of evil...

...磨得锋利 准备袭击的时候...
...are sharpened and points to strike...

...英雄必须独自去面对 他的最大的挑战
...the hero must go and face his greatest challenge alone.

但如果说闪电狗曾教会我什么的话...
But if Bolt's taught me anything,...

...那就是在他需要的时候 你绝不能丢下你的朋友!
...it's that you never abandon a friend in a time of need!

你的队友遇到困难 你就要挺身而出
When your team mates in trouble, you go.

不管他们是否向你求助 你都得去帮助他们!
Whether they ask or not, you go!

即使你不晓得 你是否还能活着回来...
Not knowing if you're coming back dead or alive...

他是朝另外一个方向去的
He went the other way.

...你得去帮助他们!即使 这要穷尽你毕生之力 也得去!
...you go! Knowing your deepest ravel it's gonna appears your eye, you go!

Penny!
Penny!

不会吧! 哇哦! 闪电狗! 老兄 我可是你的忠实粉丝
No way! Wow! Bolt! I'm really a big fan of yours, brother.

我是布莱克 这是我的朋友汤姆 汤姆 打声招呼
I'm Blake. This is my friend, Tom. Tom, say what's up.

- 你好吗? - 哇!
- What's up? - Wow!

哦 不!
Oh, no!

这是我们的私人助理 比利...
And this is our personal assistant, Billy...

...他应该现在在电线上停着的
...who is supposed to wait up on the wire.

闪电狗 我已经仰慕你好久啦 有几句话我一直好想和你说...
Bolt, I've been admired you such a long time and there is something I always wanted...

...如果我有机会遇到你的话 现在我...
...to tell you if I ever get a chance to meet you. Now I...

好了 比利 你吓到人家了
Okay Billy, that was horrifying what you just did.

想要做些好事么?去拿些面包屑给我 要全谷物的 去吧!
Wanna make something useful? Go get me some bread crumbs. Whole grain. Go!

全谷物的 不是全麦的 比利!
Whole-wheat is not the same thing as whole grain, Billy!

- 不一样的 比利! - 不要拿全麦的回来!
- Not the same, Billy! - Do not come out with whole-wheat!

也不要黑面包 比利
Or pumpernickle Billy!

- 好吧 朋友们 我得走了 - 我知道 你一直很忙

但你能不能抽几分钟听一下 我们对你节目的精彩策划...
But if you got a second for a lovely picture idea for your show,...

...汤姆比我会讲 由他来向你解释
...Tom has better pitching. I'll let him taking from here.

让我们把话筒交给汤姆
Tom has got the spotlight.

让我们拭目以待!
Wait for it!

- 外星人 - 很简单吧!
- Aliens. - Holy snap!

- 外星人? - 观众们喜欢外星人
- Aliens? - Audiences love aliens.

啊哈!
Holy crap!

- 他们应该是巨人 巨大的人! - 你碰不到我们的!
- It will be huge man! Huge! - You can't touch us!

挺好啊 其实我想问问你们 是否可以帮我找到Penny...
I love it. I'll tell you what, if you guys can help me find Penny,...

...就是那个电视里的女孩...
...the girl from the television show...

...我想进一步听听这个关于 外星人的点子 但是边走边说!
...I'd love hear more about this aliens idea, but on the way.

- 我们有希望啦! - 别激动!
- We got a nibble! - Don't freak out.

你这么搞砸"海底总动员"的
This is how you blew with Nemo.

我们以外太空的场景开始
We open exterior outer space scenery.

卡利科来抓Penny了
Calico comes for your Penny.

然后你就去揍扁他!
And then you squish him.

然后传输光束把你和Penny 带去外星人的母舰...
And as the tractor beam is pulling Penny and you to aliens' mother ship...

...画面渐暗
...we fade to black.

接着我们为片尾加上 首绝妙的流行歌
And we have a great pop song for the end credits.

和你的人谈一谈吧 我们策划的差不多了
Talk your people. We're ready to move on this.

这是绿眼人的老窝!
The lair of the green-eyed man!

犀牛 等等!
Rhino, hold up!

等等!
Hold up!

怎么 怎么啦? 我...难道我看上去不够帅?
What, what is the problem? I'm... I'm popped?

你听着 也许这对你来说 有点不可思议...
Listen, this may be really hard for you to understand...

...但 有时事情的真相很复杂...
...but you see, sometimes things aren't what they seem to be...

...有时你认为它是真的 但事实上却不是...
...and sometimes when you think something is really real and it's not,...

我等这一刻已经很久了
All of my training has prepared me for this moment.

去死吧!去死吧!
Die! Die!

准备去死吧 大走狗! 我要吃掉你的胰腺...
Prepare yourself, follow man beast! I will eat your pancreas...

...连同你的脾脏 我还要 把你的肝脏从你的身体里掏...
...with your spleen and then I will rip your liver out of your...

你长着小胡子 真可爱啊!
