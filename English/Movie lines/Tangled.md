很久以前，一抹阳光从天空坠落

在它落下的地方，长出了一朵金色的魔花

它能治愈疾病和伤痛

24
00:02:07,312 --> 00:02:10,565
她要让自己永葆青春

00:22:19,732 --> 00:22:21,943
这么巧…我也有！
Uh... I do, too!

310
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,362
但是我的惊喜肯定更大哦！
Ooh, I bet my surprise is bigger!

311
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:27,031
真的吗？我可不信
(SOFTLY) I seriously doubt it.

312
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:31,786
我带了防风草，做你最喜欢的榛子汤
I brought back parsnips. I'm going  to make hazelnut soup for dinner.

313
00:22:31,953 --> 00:22:34,289
你最喜欢的，高兴吧！
Your favourite. Surprise!

314
00:22:34,414 --> 00:22:36,749
好吧，妈妈，我要跟你说件事
Well, Mother, there's something I want to tell you.

315
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,669
又来了，乖女儿，我不想跟你吵架
Oh, Rapunzel, you know I hate leaving you after a fight.

316
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:42,213
尤其在我没做错任何事的时候
Especially when I've done absolutely nothing wrong.

317
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,632
我很仔细地考虑了你之前说的话
I've been thinking a lot about what you said earlier.

318
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,260
你不会又想重提看星星的事吧
I hope you're not still talking about the stars.

319
00:22:47,427 --> 00:22:49,762
是“孔明灯”，没错，就是这个
"Floating lights," and, yes, I'm leading up to that.

320
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:52,348
我以为这个问题已经不存在了，宝贝
Because I really thought we dropped the issue, sweetheart.

321
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:54,517
不是，妈妈，我想说的是
No, Mother, I'm just saying,

322
00:22:54,684 --> 00:22:57,103
你觉得我太柔弱，不能独立
you think I'm not strong enough to handle myself out there.

323
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,440
呵呵，亲爱的，你确实是这样
Oh, I know you're not strong enough to handle yourself out there.

324
00:23:00,607 --> 00:23:03,818
- 但如果你… - 这事我们已经讨论过了
- But if you just... - We're done talking about this.

325
00:23:03,985 --> 00:23:06,404
- 相信我！我知道自己… - 好了，乖女儿
- Trust me! I know what I'm... - Rapunzel.

326
00:23:06,571 --> 00:23:09,032
- 噢，拜托！ - 说够多了！
- Oh, come on! - Enough with the lights!

327
00:23:09,198 --> 00:23:13,578
你不准出塔！永远都不许！
You are not leaving this tower! Ever!

328
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:23,588
你满意了，我现在是彻彻底底的大坏人了
(GROANS) Great. Now I'm the bad guy.

329
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,895
其实我想说的是，妈妈…
All I was going to say, Mother, is that...

330
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:42,357
我想好要什么生日礼物了
I know what I want for my birthday now.

331
00:23:42,482 --> 00:23:44,442
你想要什么？
And what is that?

332
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:46,152
新颜料
New paint.

333
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:50,156
你给我买的那种带白贝壳的
The paint made from the white   you once brought me.

334
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:55,411
那太远了，将近要三天的路程啊
That is a very long trip, Rapunzel. Almost three days' time.

335
00:23:55,745 --> 00:24:00,750
我只是觉得这个礼物比星星好点儿
I just thought it was a better idea than the stars.

336
00:24:02,502 --> 00:24:03,628
(SIGHS)

337
00:24:04,963 --> 00:24:07,215
你自己一个人没问题吧？
You'll be all right on your own?

338
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:10,802
我在这里再安全不过了
I know I'm safe as long as I'm here.

339
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:21,271
那我三天之后回来
GOTHEL: I'll be back in three days' time.

340
00:24:22,313 --> 00:24:24,482
我非常爱你，亲爱的
I love you very much, dear.

341
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:26,776
我更爱你
RAPUNZEL: I love you more.

342
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,988
我最爱你
GOTHEL: I love you most.

343
00:24:48,172 --> 00:24:50,425
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

344
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:51,801
好吧
Okay.

345
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:09,193
Huh.

346
00:25:21,998 --> 00:25:23,333

(GRUNTING)

350
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:40,308
难道这些是头发？
FLYNN: Is this hair?

351
00:25:41,142 --> 00:25:44,228
挣扎…挣扎也是没有意义的
Struggling... Struggling is pointless.

352
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:45,396
啊？
Huh?

353
00:25:45,605 --> 00:25:47,231
(RAPUNZEL CLAMBERING DOWN)

354
00:25:47,857 --> 00:25:52,362
我知道你什么来头，我不怕你
I know why you're here, and I'm not afraid of you.

355
00:25:52,904 --> 00:25:54,405
啥？
What?

356
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,584
你是谁？你怎么找到我的？
Who are you? And how did you find me?

357
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:08,795
(STAMMERING SOFTLY)

358
00:26:10,171 --> 00:26:13,383
你是谁，怎么找到我的？
(ENUNCIATING) Who are you, and how did you find me?

(CLEARS THROAT)

360
00:26:16,886 --> 00:26:20,890
我不知道你是谁，到这里也不是为了找你
I know not who you are, nor how I came to find you.

361
00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:22,892
我只能说…
But may I just say...

362
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,979
嗨
Hi.

363
00:26:28,314 --> 00:26:30,984
你好吗？我叫福林·瑞德
How you doing? The name's Flynn Rider.

364
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,362
你最近怎么样？
How's your day going? Huh?

365
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:35,571
(GRUNTS IN CONFUSION)

366
00:26:35,863 --> 00:26:39,409
还有谁知道我在这儿，福林·瑞德？
Who else knows my location, Flynn Rider?

367
00:26:39,575 --> 00:26:41,619
- 好了，金发美女 - 我叫长发公主
- All right, blondie. - Rapunzel.

368
00:26:41,786 --> 00:26:43,371
祝您身体健康，事情是这样的
Gesundheit. Here's the deal.

369
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:46,374
我当时在林子里瞎逛
I was in a situation, gallivanting through the forest.

370
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,710
无意间发现这个塔…
I came across your tower and...

371
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:50,086
然后，天哪，不会吧
Oh! Oh, no.

372
00:26:50,336 --> 00:26:51,462
我的背包呢？
Where is my satchel?

373
00:26:51,838 --> 00:26:54,966
我藏起来了，你找不到的
I've hidden it. Somewhere you'll never find it.

374
00:26:58,052 --> 00:26:59,762
就在那个罐子里，对吧？
It's in that pot, isn't it?

啊？
Huh?

378
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,396
你能不能别这样？
(EX CLAIMS) Would you stop that?

379
00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:11,357
这次我把背包藏在你绝对找不到的地方
Now it's hidden where you'll never find it.

380
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:16,195
你想把我的头发怎么样？剪下来吗？
So, what do you want with my hair? To cut it?

381
00:27:16,362 --> 00:27:17,530
- 啥？ - 卖钱吗？
- What? - Sell it?

382
00:27:17,697 --> 00:27:21,284
不是！听着，我唯一可能需要你头发的地方
No! Listen, the only thing I want to do with your hair

383
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:23,703
是想离开这里，就是字面上的意思
is to get out of it, literally.

384
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,871
你…
You...

385
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:27,582
等下，你不是想要我的头发？
Wait. You don't want my hair?

386
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:29,626
我为什么要你的头发？
Why on earth would I want your hair?

387
00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:32,253
听着，我被人追，看见这塔就爬上来了
Look, I was being chased, I saw a tower, I climbed it.

388
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,421
就这些
End of story.

389
00:27:33,588 --> 00:27:35,006
你说的是真的？
(STAMMERING) You're telling the truth?

390
00:27:35,214 --> 00:27:36,424
没错！
Yes!

391
00:27:36,716 --> 00:27:37,717
Hmm.

我知道，也许正好可以跟他出塔
(WHISPERING) I know. I need someone to take me.

396
00:27:51,856 --> 00:27:54,275
我也觉得他说的是实话
- (SQUEAKING) - I think he's telling the truth, too.

397
00:27:54,442 --> 00:27:57,528
他不是吸血鬼啊，我又能怎么办呢？
He doesn't have fangs. But what choice do I have?

Okay, Flynn Rider, I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

- Deal? - Look this way.

你知道这些是什么吗？
Do you know what these are?

403
00:28:09,874 --> 00:28:12,919
你说的是他们为公主放的孔明灯？
You mean the lantern thing they do for the princess?

404
00:28:13,586 --> 00:28:16,923
孔明灯？我就知道不是星星
Lanterns? I knew they weren't stars.

405
00:28:18,091 --> 00:28:20,343
好吧，明晚
Well, tomorrow evening,

406
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:24,305
他们又会用灯笼点亮夜空
they will light the night sky with these lanterns.

407
00:28:24,472 --> 00:28:27,976
你给我当向导，带我去看灯
You will act as my guide, take me to these lanterns,

408
00:28:28,142 --> 00:28:29,644
然后再把我安全送回家
and return me home safely.

409
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:34,065
然后我就把包还给你
Then, and only then, will I return your satchel to you.

410
00:28:34,232 --> 00:28:35,358
你觉得怎么样？
That is my deal.

411
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:36,609
这个啊
Yeah.

没门儿
No can do.

414
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:43,157
非常不幸，那个国王和我的关系很不…“和谐”
Unfortunately the kingdom and I aren't exactly simpatico at the moment,

415
00:28:43,324 --> 00:28:45,535
所以我哪里都不能带你去
so I won't be taking you anywhere.

416
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:55,295
是上天带你来这儿的，福林·瑞德
Something brought you here, Flynn Rider.

417
00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:56,796
你怎么说都行
Call it what you will,

418
00:28:56,963 --> 00:28:59,716
- 天数，命运… - 是一匹马
- fate, destiny... - A horse.

419
00:28:59,882 --> 00:29:02,135
所以我选择相信你
So I have made the decision to trust you.

420
00:29:02,302 --> 00:29:03,261
这可不是什么好主意，真心这么觉得
A horrible decision, really.

421
00:29:03,428 --> 00:29:06,431
但是相信我的话
But trust me when I tell you this.

422
00:29:08,474 --> 00:29:11,853
哪怕你把这个塔给拆了
You can tear this tower apart brick by brick,

423
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,691
没我的帮助，你绝对找不到你那宝贝包的
but without my help, you will never find your precious satchel.

我带你去看孔明灯，再送你回家
I take you to see the lanterns, bring you back home,

427
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:24,824
然后你把包还给我？
and you'll give me back my satchel?

428
00:29:24,991 --> 00:29:26,409
我保证
I promise.

429
00:29:28,328 --> 00:29:32,957
决不食言
And when I promise something, I never, ever break that promise.

绝对
- Ever. - (SQUEAKS IN AGREEMENT)

431
00:29:40,048 --> 00:29:42,342
好吧，听着，这事并不是非做不可
All right, listen. I didn't want to have to do this,

432
00:29:42,508 --> 00:29:44,177
但我别无选择
but you leave me no choice.

00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:46,804
我很生气
Here comes the smoulder.

This is kind of an off day for me. This doesn't normally happen.

Did I ever tell you I've got a thing for brunettes?

后面的故事，想必你们都知道了吧

王国举国欢庆，庆祝公主回归

这家伙？他终于找到了真爱

这家伙，我想他应该很欢乐 虽然他从来没跟我说
As for this guy, I assume he's happy. He's never told me otherwise.

就像国内的苹果一样

就像她父母一样
that her parents did before her.

1261
01:30:40,291 --> 01:30:43,378
至于我，我开始用尤金
And, as for me, I started going by Eugene again,

1262
01:30:43,503 --> 01:30:45,588
当然不是继续做老本行 一百八十度大转弯了
stopped thieving and turned it all around.

1263
01:30:45,755 --> 01:30:48,216

我很高兴的告诉你
I'm pleased to tell you

然后我们从此过上了幸福的生活
