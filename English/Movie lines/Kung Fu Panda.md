功夫熊猫
传奇故事传颂着一名传奇武士 
Legend tells of a legendary warrior, 
他的功夫无人能敌 
whose kung fu skills 
were the stuff of legend. 
浪迹江湖 一路行侠仗义 
He travelled the land 
in search of worthy foes. 
既然你这么爱吃 
试吃看看我的拳头如何! 
I see you like to chew. 
Maybe you should chew on my fist. 
武士一言未发 因为他嘴里塞满了食物 
The warrior said anything 
for his mouth was full. 
但他一口把食物吞下 然后说 
"少啰唆! 接招吧!" 
Then he swallowed. 
And then he spoke. 
Enough talk. Let's fight. 
看招 
他的致命招数无人能挡 
He was so deadly in fact, 
that his enemies will go blind, 
敌人都被他的正义之光闪瞎了眼 
from over exposure to pure 
awesomeness. 
我看不见了! 
他武功盖世! 
极具魅力 
My eyes! 
He's too awesome! 
我们该怎么报答你呢? 
And attractive. 
How can we re-pay you? 
"路见不平，拔刀相助" 无需回报! 
There is no charge for awesomeness. 
Or attractiveness. 
爆发吧! 
千军万马全被踏在足下 艺高人胆大 
It mattered not how many foes he faced. 
有史以来最使人敬畏 
Never before had a panda 
been so feared, and so loved. 
又最令人销魂的熊猫 
即使是打败天下无敌手的中原五侠客 
也对他佩服得五体投地 
Even the most heroic heroes 
in all of China, 
The Furious Five. 
Bowed in respect to this great master. 
什么时候一起出去放松放松 
没问题 
We should hang out. 
Agreed. 
但现在不是放松的时候 
面对石门山一万疯狂大军时 
But hanging out would 
have to wait. 
Cause when you're facing the ten 
thousand demons of demon mountain. 
当务之急是... 
There is only one thing 
that matters and thats... 
你该起床 
不然要迟到了 
Get up! 
You'll be late for work. 
啥? 
阿波 快起床 
Po... 
Get up! 
阿波 你在那干嘛呢 
Hey, Po. 
What are you doing up there? 
没干嘛 
Ahh.. nothing. 
猴子! 螳螂! 仙鹤! 毒蛇! 老虎! 
Monkey, Mantis, Crane, Viper, 
Tigress ... Roarrrr! 
Ahh... 
阿波 快点 你要迟到了 
Po. Let's go. 
You're late for work. 
我来了 
Coming! 
对不起 老爸 
对不起有什么用 又不能拿它来煮面条 
Sorry Dad. 
Sorry, doesn't make the Noodles. 
你刚在楼上干什么 那么吵? 
What were you doing up there? 
All that noise? 
没什么 做了个怪梦而已 
Oh...nothing. 
Just had a crazy dream. 
关于什么的梦? 你梦到什么了? 
About what? Uh? 
What were you dreaming about? 
我梦到... 
What was I...aah... 
... I was dreaming about a... 
面条了 
面条? 你真的梦到面条了? 
Noodles. 
Noodles? 
You were really dreaming about noodles? 
是啊 不然我还能梦什么 
Uhh... Ya, 
what else would I be dreaming about? 
当心面汤很"烫" 
Oh, careful. 
That soup is - sharp! 
太令人高兴了 
Oh... happy day. 
My son finally having the noodle dream. 
我的儿子终于梦到了面条 
你不知道为了这一刻 
我已经等待了多久 
You don't know how long 
I have been waiting for this moment. 
这是个好兆头 阿波 
This is a sign, Po. 
什么事情的兆头? 
Uh... a sign of what? 
你就要准备好继承我的"神秘配方汤"的神秘配方了 
You are almost ready to be 
entrusted with the secret ingredient, 
... of my secret ingredient soup. 
然后实现你的命运 接管这间餐馆 
And then you will fulfill your destiny 
and take over the restaurant. 
就像我从我父亲那继承 
Just as I took over from my father 
who took over from his father. 
他又继承自他的父亲 
最早是他和朋友打麻将赢来的 
who won it from a friend 
over a game of mahjong. 
老爸 别激动 不过是个梦 
Dad, dad, dad. 
It was just a dream. 
不 这不是一般的梦 
No, it was the Dream. 
我们是面条世家 
Wu Xiang noodles. 
Po, broth runs through our veins. 
面汤在我们的血液中流串着 
但是 老爸 你有没有想过... 
去干点别的 
But Dad, didn't you ever 
wanted to do something else? 
除了做面条之外 
Something, beside noodles. 
实际上 想当年我年轻气盛时 
Actually, when I was young 
and crazy. 
也曾想过要离家出走 去学做豆腐 
I thought of running away 
and learning how to make tofu. 
为什么没去呢? 
So why didn't you? 
因为那个梦想愚蠢得很 
Oh, because it was 
a stupid dream. 
你能想象我做豆腐是什么样子吗? 
Can you imagine me making tofu? 
啊哈哈哈 豆腐? 
Ha, ha, ha. Tofu! 
笑死人了 
我绝不会干 
No, we all have our place 
in this world. 
我们都有自己的宿命 
我的地盘就是这 而你的... 
My is here and yours is... 
... I know "is here". 
我知道 也是这 
不对 是2号 9号 7号和12号桌的 
No, its tables 2, 5 ,7 and 12. 
别忘了微笑 
Service with a smile. 
干得好 徒弟们 
你们让我失望的本领真好 
Well done, students... 
... if you were trying 
to disappoint me. 
小虎 不够凶狠 
Tigress, you need more ferocity. 
Monkey greater speed. 
大猴 加快速度 
老鹤 再高点 
毒蛇 不够灵巧 螳螂... 
Crane, height. Viper, subtlety. 
Mantis... Master Shifu... 
- 师傅 
- 干嘛? 
Master Shifu... What? 
龟仙人有请 
It...its Master Oogway, 
he wants to see you. 
龟仙人 您召见我有何贵干? 
Master Oogway, you summoned me? 
Is something wrong? 
一定得有要事 
才能见见自己的老朋友吗 
Why must something be wrong 
for me to want to see my old friend? 
这么说来...没事? 
So, nothing is wrong? 
Well, I didn't say that. 
我可没那么说 
你是想说... 
You were saying? 
我预见到...太郎将重出江湖 
I have had a vision. 
Tai Lung will return. 
这不可能! 他身处狱中 
That is impossible. 
He's in prison. 
万事皆有可能 
Nothing is impossible. 
平先生 火速飞去啸岗监狱 
Zeng, fly to Chordom Prison. 
Tell them to double the guards, 
叫他们把狱守数量加倍 把武器加倍 
Double the weapons. 
Double everything. 
把一切都加倍 
- 绝不能让太郎逃出来 
- 是! 师傅 
Tai Lung does not leave 
that prison. 
Yes, Master Shifu. 
命中注定的事 躲也躲不过 
One often meets his destiny on 
the road he takes to avoid it. 
我们必须有所行动 
如果太郎真的回到和平谷报仇 
We have to do something. We can't 
just have him march in the valley. 
And take his revenge. 
He'll, he'll... 
他会... 他会... 
你的心好似这潭湖水 老朋友 
Your mind is like this water 
my friend. When it is agitated... 
如果波澜起伏 就会模糊不清 
... it becomes difficult to see. 
但如果平静下来 
But if you allow it to settle, 
the answer becomes clear. 
解决之道必将自现 
龙之典 
The Dragon's scroll. 
时候到了... 
It is time. 
But who? 
但是谁呢? 
谁有资格继承这无穷的力量? 
Who is worthy to be trusted 
with the secret to limitless power? 
谁有资格成为龙斗士? 
To become the Dragon Warrior. 
我不知道 
I don't know. 
不好意思 借过 
Excuse me. Sorry. 
- 嘿 看着点 阿波 
- 对不起 卡住了 
Oo...oo sorry. 
Hey, watch it Po. 
Sorry. 
Aah... Oop! 
抱歉 没关系 我洗过澡了... 
Sorry, a thousand pardon. 
快看! 
What? 
龟仙人要比武挑选龙斗士了 
就在今天 
Master Oogway is choosing 
a Dragon Warrior, today. 
大家快去玉殿 
Everyone, everyone, go! 
Get to the Jade Palace! 
中原五侠客之一将被授予龙之典 
One of the five is going 
to get the Dragon's Scroll. 
等了几千年终于等到今天 
赶快吃 吃完快走 
We have been waiting a thousand 
years for this. Just take the bowl! 
快去呀!! 
这是武林史上的一大盛事 
This is the greatest day in Kung Fu 
history! Don't worry about it. Just go! 
别管钱了 快走吧 
阿波 你要上哪去? 
Po! Where are you going? 
上玉殿去 
To the Jade Palace. 
带上你的面条小车 
But you're forgetting your noodle cart. 
整个山谷的村民都会上那去 
The whole valley will be there and 
you will sell noodle to all of them. 
我们的面条就能卖疯了 
卖面条? 
Selling noodles? 
- 老爸 我在想... 
- 什么? 
But Dad. You know I was kind 
of thinking, maybe I... 
- 或许我可以... 
- 什么? 
Ya? 
I was kind of thinking, maybe I... 
Ahh...Haa..? 
把面条和馒头放一块卖 
Could also sell the bean buns. 
They're about to go bad. 
馒头放着都快发霉了 
这才是我的儿子! 
That's my boy! 
I told you that dream was a sign. 
我就说那个梦是个好兆头 
没错 做这个梦真好... 
Ya... 
I'm glad I had it. 
我是武林高手! 
我也是! 
加油 加油 就快到了 
Almost there. 
老天别这么对我 
别这么对我 
What? 
No! 
No! No! 
我们先走了 阿波 
Sorry Po. 
We'll bring you back a souvenir. 
放心吧 会给你带纪念品的 
那怎么行 我自己来 
No, I'll bring you back a souvenir. 
It's a historic day. 
Isn't it Master Oogway? 
今天将会是历史性的一天 是吧? 龟仙人 
是啊 没想到我能活着看到这天 
Yes. The one I feared 
I would not live to see. 
你的徒弟们准备好了吗? 
Are your students ready? 
Yes, Master Oogway. 
一切就绪了 龟仙人 
记好了 老朋友 
Now know this old friend... 
选中的人不但会给山谷带来安宁 
Whomever I chose will not only bring 
peace to the valley, but also to you. 
还能抚平你的心灵 
武林大会正式开始!

最后上场的是...悍娇虎 
And finally, Master Tigress. 
相信我 村民们 
你们还没见到真正的绝招 
Believe me citizens, 
you have not seen anything yet. 
还用你说 
I know! 
她的杀手• 
除了强壮的体魄和犀利的眼神外 
Master Tigress faces Iron Arms 
and its Blades of Death. 
还有其致命的虎爪功 
我感受到了...龙斗士...气脉 
I sense the Dragon Warrior 
is among us. 
和平谷的村民们 
Citizens of the Valley of Peace, 
龟仙人将挑选龙斗士的继承者 
Master Oogway will now choose 
the Dragon Warrior. 
就选了! 等一等 
Hah...butta...

你说我是在干嘛? 
别吹 别吹 我要去看龙斗士 
Stop! Stop! 
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior. 
But I don't understand, 
you finally have the noodle dream. 
我不明白你怎么了 
你好不容易才做了关于面条的梦 
我撒谎了 老爸 我没梦到面条 
I lied. 
I don't dream about noodles, Dad. 
I love Kung Fu...uuu! 
我爱武功 
Oh come on son. 
Let's get back to work. 
好了 儿子 回去工作吧 
Heay...okay. 
好吧 
Ahh...aahh...aah. 
Po!...Heay...heay...hey. 
Oh...Somebody... 
儿子! 
Oh. What's going on? 
我是要...我在哪? 
... Where? 
你在指什么? 
Why are you pointing...? 
Oh. Okay. Sorry. I just wanted 
to see who the Dragon Warrior was? 
对不起 我只想看看谁成为了龙斗士 
真有意思 
How interesting? 
龟仙人 您是在指我吗? 
Master, are you pointing at me? 
- 我在指他 
- 指谁? 
Him. 
Who? 
- 就是你 
- 我? 
You. 
Me? 
The universe has brought 
us the Dragon Warrior. 
冥冥宇宙为我们指定了龙斗士 
What? What? 
What? What! 
怎么可能? 
怎么可能? 
Stop wait. 
Who told you to... 
等等 停下来 谁让你们... 
龟仙人 等一下 
Master Oogway, wait. 
That crabby panda can't possibly 
be the answer to our problem. 
那个大肥熊猫 
绝不可能解决我们的问题! 
You were about to appoint the Tigress. 
and that thing fell in front of her. 
你是要指小虎的 
结果那东西掉到了她面前 
That was just an accident. 
There are no accidents. 
完全是个巧合! 
世间无巧合 
Forgive us Master. 
We have failed you. 
恕我们无能 师父令您失望了 
No. If the panda has not quit by 
morning, then I would have failed you. 
先别急 若明早之前 
这个熊猫还未自行退出 
那就是我的失职 
刀下留人 我是来送信的 
是宗师的信 
Wait, wait, wait! 
I bring a message from Master Shifu. 
你说什么? 要我们把狱守数量加倍? 
What? Double the guard. 
Extra precautions. 
还要增加额外防范措施? 
"监狱防卫设施可能不够" 
Your prison may not be adequate? 
你怀疑我的监狱不安全? 
You doubt my prison security? 
当然不是 
Absolutely not! 
是师傅对此不放心 我只是个送信的 
Shifu does. 
I'm just the messenger. 
那你帮我回个话 
I'll give you a message 
for your Master Shifu. 
从啸岗监狱逃跑简直是天方夜谭 
Escape from Chordom prison 
is impossible. 
惊人吧 
Impressive isn't it? 
惊人至极 
Yes, very impressive. 
It is very impressive. 
进出都只有一条道 
One way in. 
And one way out. 
一千个狱守监视一个犯人 
One thousand guards 
and one prisoner. 
我知道 但这个犯人可是...太郎 
Yes, except that prisoner is Tai Lung. 
把我们放下去 
Take us down. 
Ahh...ahh...ahh...ahh 
Oh...oo...oh.. 
天哪 
Oh my... 
这就是太郎 
Behold Tai Lung. 
我还是在这里等你吧 
I'll umm...I'll just 
wait right here. 
没什么好怕的 安全的很 
It's nothing to worry about. 
It's perfectly safe. 
弓箭手随时待命 
Both posts. 
At the ready. 
小子 听说没 
龟仙人终于找人继承龙之典了 
Hey tough guy. 
Did you hear... 
Oogway is finally going to give 
someone the Dragon Scroll... 
而这个人肯定不会是你 
...and it's not going to be you. 
你在干嘛 别惹恼了他 
What are you doing? 
Don't get him mad. 
他能把我怎么样 
他连一根指头都动不了 
What is he going to do about it? 
I've got him completely immobilised. 
Haa...haa...haa...haa! 
哦啊 我是不是踩到小豹豹的尾巴了 
Oh...Did I step on 
the wooly kiddy's tail? 
行了 我已经看够了 
I'm gonna... I've seen enough. 
我会转达宗师没什么好担心的 
I'm gonna tell Shifu that he 
has nothing to worry about. 
- 没错 他完全不必担心 
- 我会传达的 
No, he doesn't. 
Okay I'll tell him that. 
能离开这了吗? 
Hmm... 
Can we please go now? 
等一下 
Oh. Wait a second. 
这里面可能有点小误会 
I think there has been 
a slight mistake. 
似乎每个人都认为我是... 
Err...Everyone seems 
to think I'm err... 
哇塞! 这不是隐秘的侠者之殿吗? 
Ahh...The sacred Hall of Warriors. 
No way. 
看看这个地方 
Look at this place. 
犀牛大侠的盔甲 
Master Flying-Rhino's armour. 
连打仗时受的损伤都还在! 
With authentic battle damage! 
英雄剑 
Wow...the Sword of Heroes. 
锋利到看一眼都会被割伤 
Said to be so sharp, you can cut 
yourself just by looking ... Aah!...Oww! 
隐形的青龙偃月刀 
The invisible Dragon of Destiny. 
我终于看到这幅画了 
真的是这幅画吗? 
Uuhhs... I've only seen paintings 
of that painting. 
Aah...ah...ha...ha...ha... 
Heeyah...yah.. Aah...ah...ah.. 
不会吧 
Noo..! Ho...oh, oh, oh... 
传说中装载着武士耳语的瓷瓮 
The legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors. 
整个天蜀军尽在其中 
Said to contain souls of the 
entire Tenshu army. 
有人在吗? 
Hello? 
Have you finished sightseeing? 
你游览完了吗? 
对不起 我应该第一个就来看你的 
Sorry. I should have 
come to see you first. 
我没什么耐心 
My patience is running thin. 
Ohh? 
Well. I mean, it's not like 
you are going anywhere. 
反正你也跑不掉 
- 转过身来 
- 好的 
You turn around. 
Sure. 
Hey, how is it going? 
How do you get 500...Master Shifu!... Ooh!... 
:///C|//（第 15／54 页）[]:///C|//
你好 
你是怎么...宗师! 
有人把花瓶打破了 
Ohh...whooo... 
Someone broke that... 
But I'm going to fix it...I... 
我会把它补好的 你有胶水吗? 
Do you have some glue... 
Whooo.... 
Aah...ouch...ooo! 
I've a splinter. 
啊! 噢~ 噢~ 扎到我了 
你就是传说中的龙斗士 嗯? 
So you are the legendary Dragon Warrior? 
Hmm... 
- 呃! 大概是吧 
- 错 
Ahh, I guess so? 
Wrong! 
你不是龙斗士 也不可能成为龙斗士 
You are not the Dragon Warrior. 
You will never be the Dragon Warrior... 
... until you've learned the secret 
of the Dragon scroll. 
除非你能领悟龙之典中的奥义 
哇噢! 
Wow...so... 
How does this work? 
那么 该怎么做? 
你有没梯子 弹簧床之类的东西? 
Do you have a ladder? 
a trampoline or...? 
你太天真了 以为我会就这样把 
无穷力量的奥秘告诉你? 
Umph...You think it is that easy? 
That I'm just going to hand you 
the secret to limitless power? 
不是 我.. 
No! I... 
你必须先达到武学的最高境界 
One must first master the highest 
level of Kung Fu 
像你这样的人 是绝对不可能的 
:///C|//（第 16／54 页）[]:///C|//
and that is clearly impossible 
if that one is someone like you. 
- 我这样的人? 
- 是啊 
Someone like me? 
Yes! 
看看你自己 
Look at you! 
This fat blob. Flabby arms. 
肥嘟嘟的屁股 软绵绵的胳膊 
软绵绵的地方最敏感了 
Those are sensitive. 
in the flabby parts. 
还有这个傻呼呼的肚子 
And this ridiculous belly. 
Hey...whooo... 
也不注意个人卫生 
And utter disregard for personal hygiene. 
Now wait a minute. 
嘿 等等 这不公平 
That's a little uncalled for. 
Don't stand that close. I can smell your breath. 
别站那么近 我都闻到你的口臭了 
听着 是龟仙人说我... 
Listen, Oogway said that I was the... 
Uh... the Wushi Finger Hold. 
无极拈花指 
别 别 无极拈花指 
Never... Master Shifu don't... 
噢! 你也知道这一招? 
Haa...oh... You know this hold? 
由无极大师于第三朝时创立 是的! 
Developed by Master Wushi in the 
3rd dynasty. Yes. 
那你也该知道弹一下之后的后果啰 
Oh. Then you must know what happens 
when I flex my pinky. 
不要! 不要! 
那你知道最难的是什么吗? 
No, no, no... 
You know the hardest part of this?... 
The hardest part is cleaning up afterwards. 
最难的是事后清理你的残骸! 
:///C|//（第 17／54 页）[]:///C|//
好的 好的 别冲动 
Humm... 
Okay. Okay, take it easy. 
你给我听好了 熊猫 
Now listen closely, Panda. 
龟仙人也许挑中了你 
Oogway may have picked you, 
but when I'm through with you,... 
但我向你保证 
你会希望他当初没选重你 
I promise you, 
you're going to wish he hadn't. 
懂了吗? 
Are we clear? 
是的 懂了 完全了解 
Yes, we're clear, we're clear. 
We are so clear. 
很好 我等不及要开始了 
Good. Hmm, Hmm, Hmm. 
I can't wait to get started. 
开始吧 
Let's begin. 
等等 什么 现在? 
Wait, wait, wait. 
是的 现在 
Now? 
Yes now. 
除非你觉得龟仙人错了 
你也不是龙斗士 
Unless you think that the great Oogway was 
wrong and you are not the Dragon Warrior. 
好吧! 我不知道我能不能做完那些动作 
Okay. Well, I don't know 
if I can do all of those moves. 
不试试怎么知道呢? 
Well, if we don't try, 
we will never know, will we? 
也没错 不过我们或许该找个 
更适合我水平的 
Yes, it's just, maybe we can find 
something more suited to my level. 
你是什么水平? 
你知道...我不是大师... 
:///C|//（第 18／54 页）[]:///C|//
And what level is that? 
Well you know... 
那从最基础的开始吧 最最基础的 
I'm not a master, but 
let's just start at zero. 
没有最最基础这个东西 
Level zero. 
There is no such thing as level zero. 
- 嗨! 也许我可以从这里起步 
- 那个? 
Hey, maybe I can start with that. 
这是训练小孩子用的 
That. We use that 
for training children. 
天热的时候也可以用来抵门 
And popping the door 
open when it is hot. 
但如果你坚持的话 
哇噢! 五侠客 
But if you insist. 
Wow... The Furious Five. 
你们比市面上你们的玩偶大多了 
除了你 幻影螳螂 
你的玩偶和你差不多 
You're so much bigger 
than your action figures. 
Except for you, Mantis. 
You're about the same. 
来吧 熊猫 给我们看看你有什么能耐 
Go ahead, Panda. 
Show us what you can do. 
他们也要看? 
还是等他们回去练功后 我再开始 
Ahh...Are they going to watch? Or should I just 
wait until they get back to work or something? 
出手吧 
好的 我刚吃的饱饱 正在消化 
Hit it. 
Okay, I mean, I just ate, 
休息一下后效果会更好 
and so I'm still digesting, so my 
Kung Fu may not be as good as later on. 
出招就是了! 
:///C|//（第 19／54 页）[]:///C|//
唔! 你算什么 
Just hit it. 
你什么都不是 因为高手在此 
What'd you got? 
You've got nothing cos' I got it right here. 
看到我的兄弟们了吗? 
想尝尝我的雷霆之怒吗? 
You picking on my friends? 
Get ready to fell the thunder. 
无影脚就要来了 
你能应付的了无影脚吗? 
Come on, crazy feet. 
What're you going to do about crazy feet? 
来吧 我无影无踪 无影无踪 
没见过熊拳吧 
Come on. I'm a blur. I'm a blur. 
You've never seen Bear style. 
你只见过螳螂拳 
或者猴拳 
You've only seen Praying Mantis. 
Or Monkey style. 
Imagine snake-kiddy Snake. 
还是蛇拳 
你到底打还是不打! 
Would you hit it! 
好的 好的 
Alright. Alright. 
再来一次好吗 用力点 
Why don't you try it again? 
A little harder. 
这下怎么样... 
How's that? 
Oohhh... 
疼死了 
Oh, that hurts! 
看来会比我想象的容易多了 
This will be easier than I thought. 
Feeling a little nausea... 
Ouch, ouch, ouch! 
当心 
我的吗呀... 
Oohh... My tenders. 
我表现如何?? 
:///C|//（第 20／54 页）[]:///C|//
现在终于有最最基础这个东西了 
How did I do? 
There is now a level zero. 
我没有不承认 
我不懂龟仙人是怎么想的 
Don't deny that. 
I don't understand what Master Oogway was thinking. 
那个傻孩子都要没命了 
Poor guy is going to get himself killed. 
He is so fighty. 
那个龙斗士 他无比强大 
The Dragon Warrior fell out 
of the sky in a ball of fire. 
翱翔于九天 口吐烈火 
他的脚步让大地颤抖 
When he walks, 
the very ground shakes. 
本以为龟仙人会选一个懂武功的人 
One would think that Master Oogway would 
choose someone who actually knew Kung Fu. 
至少也是能摸到自己脚趾的人啊 
Yes. Or could at least touch his toes. 
Or even see his toes. 
或者能看到自己的脚趾 
好的 
Okay. 
别出动静!! 
Great. 
Ooouuch! 
- 嗨! 还没睡啊? 
- 现在醒了 
Oh hey. Hi. 
You're up? 
我只是想 
有时候武功这东西很难 是吗? 
Am now. 
I was just..er...someday...eh? 
The Kung Fu stuff is hard work, right? 
Your biceps sore. 
你二头肌酸了吗? 
我今天既累又失望 
I've had a long day and rather 
disappointing day, so...er... 
:///C|//（第 21／54 页）[]:///C|//
现在应该睡觉了 
Ya...I should probably get to sleep now. 
- 是! 是! 当然 
- 谢谢 
Ya... Ya...of course. 
Okay. Thanks. 
我太崇拜你们了 
It's just, I'm such a big fan... 
哭泣河之役你们打的太棒了! 
You guys were so totally amazing 
at the battle of the Weeping River. 
以寡敌众 无所畏惧... 
Outnumbered. A thousand to one. 
But, you didn't stop. You just,.... 
不好意思 
Oh. Sorry about that. 
听着 你不属于这里 
Ahh... Look you don't belong here. 
我知道 我知道 你说的对 
Er...I know, I know. 
You're right. 
只是我一直都梦想着... 
I don't have it. 
It's just, my whole life, I dream of... 
不 不 不 我是指的是你不属于"这里" 
No, no, no. I meant you don't 
belong here, I mean in this room. 
这间屋子 这是我的房间 
But this is my room. 
Property of Crane. 
禅灵鹤的地盘 
好的 好的 
Oh, okay right, right. 
So... 
你很困了 我还在打扰你 
Ya, you want to get to sleep. 
Keeping you up. 
明天还有很多事 
We've got big things tomorrow. 
好的 我再说一遍 你帅呆了 再见 
Alright. You are awesome. The last thing 
I'm going to say. Okay, bye-bye. 
什么? 
:///C|//（第 22／54 页）[]:///C|//
我什么都没说 
What was that? 
I didn't say anything. 
好的 好的 晚安 做个好梦 
Okay. Alright. Goodnight. 
Sleep well. 
真尴尬 
Seem a little bit awkward. 
悍娇虎大侠 
我不是故意吵醒你的 只是... 
Master Tigress, didn't mean 
to wake you. Just a... 
你不属于这里 
You don't belong here. 
Ah ya...ya, of course... 
是的 是的 当然 这是你的房间 
我是指你不属于玉殿 
This is your room... 
I mean you don't belong in the Jade Palace. 
你不尊重武功 
You're a disgrace to Kung Fu and if 
you have any respect of who we are, 
如果你真的尊敬我们 尊敬武功 
and what we do, 
you will be gone by morning. 
就该在天亮前离开 
我是你的忠实粉丝 
Big fan. 
看来你找到了神秘的圣天慧桃树了嘛 
I see you've found the Sacred Peach 
Tree of Heavenly Wisdom. 
这是智慧桃树? 
Is that what this is? 
I'm so sorry. 
对不起 我以为只是棵普通的桃树呢 
I thought it was just 
a regular peach tree. 
我明白 你不开心就会吃东西 
I understand, you eat 
when you are upset. 
不开心 我没不开心啊 
我为什么要不开心呢? 
Upset? I'm not upset. 
:///C|//（第 23／54 页）[]:///C|//
Why would I be upset? 
那么你为什么不开心呢? 
So, why are you upset? 
我大概是武林史上最差劲的了 
I probably sucked more today 
than anyone in the history of Kung Fu. 
中原史上最差劲的 
In the history of China. 
- 差劲史上最差劲的 
- 大概吧 
In the history of sucking. 
五侠客们 他们恨死我了 
Probably. 
And the Five...man, 
you should have seen them, 
they totally hate me. 
恨死了 
宗师怎么可能把我变成龙斗士呢? 
Totally. 
How's Shifu ever going to turn me 
into the Dragon Warrior? 
我又不像五侠客那样 
I mean I'm not like the Five, 
I've got no claws. 
我没有利爪 没有翅膀 没有毒液 
No wings, 
no venom. 
就连幻影螳螂都有那样的胳膊 
Even Mantis got those thingies. 
也许我应该放弃 回家做面条算了 
May be I should just quit 
and go back to making noodles. 
放弃 别放弃 
面条 别做面条 
Quit. Don't quit. 
Noodles. Don't noodles. 
你太在乎过去和将来了 
You are too concerned with 
what was and what will be. 
俗语说 过去的 已经过去了 
There's a saying. 
Yesterday is history, 
未来的 还未可知 
:///C|//（第 24／54 页）[]:///C|//
Tomorrow is a mystery, 
But today is a gift. 
现在 却是上苍的礼赠 
我们可以把握的是当下 
That is why it is called the "present". 
- 噢! 不 
- 发生什么了? 
Oh No! 
What's happening? 
To your battle stations! 
Go! Go! Go! 
弓弩手 发射 
发射 
Fire Cross-Bow! 
Fire! 
Fire! 
太郎自由了 我必须去警告宗师 
Tai Lung's free. I must warn Shifu. 
- 哪也不准去 
- 可是他... 
You are not going anywhere. 
Neither is he! 
升起来 
Let go of me. 
Bring it up! 
把他打回去 
Wait! Bring it back! 
- 他过来了 
- 他过不来的 
He's going this way. 
He won't get far. 
弓箭手 
Archers! 
我们死定了 这下死无全尸了 
We Dead. 
So very, very dead. 
现在说还早了 火箭发射 
Ha..Ha. Not yet, we're not. 
Now! 
- 现在能跑了吗? 
- 是的 
Can we run now? 
Yes. 
:///C|//（第 25／54 页）[]:///C|//
真高兴师父把你送来了 
I am glad Shifu sent you. 
我还以为我被忘了呢 
I was beginning to feel 
I'm being forgotten. 
回去告诉他们 
Fly back there and tell them, the 
real Dragon Warrior is coming home. 
真正的龙斗士要回家了 
早安 师父 
Good Morning, Master. 
熊猫 熊猫 
Panda! 
醒醒 
Panda! Wake up! 
Hmm, hmm, hmm... 
He's quitted. 
他放弃了 
现在该怎么办 师父? 
What do we do now Master 
with the Panda gone? 
熊猫走了 那谁来做龙斗士呢? 
Who will be the Dragon Warrior? 
我们只有努力修炼 相信到时候 
All we can do is resume our training 
and trust that in time... 
真正的龙斗士自然会出现 
the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed. 
你在这干什么? 
What are you doing here? 
Haa...hey. 
Good Morning Master. 
早上好 师父 我先热热身 
I thought I'll warm up a little. 
是卡住了吧? 
You're stuck. 
Stuck?...No...What?...Stuck? 
卡住了? 不 不是 怎么会 
No...This is one of the... 
Ya...I'm stuck. 
是的 我是被卡住了 
- 帮帮他 
- 天哪 
:///C|//（第 26／54 页）[]:///C|//
Help him. 
Oh dear. 
数三声一起用力 一...二... 三! 
Lift me on three. 
One, two, .... 
- 谢谢 
- 不客气 
Thank you. 
Don't mention it. 
- 不 我真的很感谢... 
- 不要跟我说谢谢 
No really. I appreciate it... 
...Ever. 
你真的指望一夜之间就学会劈山腿吗? 
You actually thought you could 
learn to do a full split in one night. 
敏捷性要训练很多年 
It takes years to develop 
ones flexibility. 
运用到实战 也要花很多年 
And years longer to apply it in combat. 
放下 
流血的指节跟断掉的骨头 
才是该收集的纪念品 
Put that down! 
The only souvenirs we collect down here 
are bloody knuckles and broken bones. 
好的 很好 
Yaa...ha...ha...ha. 
Excellent! 
我们开始吧 
Let's get started. 
- 准备好了吗 
- 一生下来就准备好了 
Are you ready? 
I was born ready...Oww! 
抱歉! 我以为你准备好了 
Oww!...Oh!. I'm sorry brother. 
I thought you said you're ready. 
太酷了! 再来一次行吗? 
That was awesome! 
Let's go again! 
之前都是手下留情 熊猫! 
:///C|//（第 27／54 页）[]:///C|//
但是到此为止 
I've been taking it easy on you Panda 
but no more. Your next opponent... 
你下一个对手 是我 
太好了 耶! 开始吧 
...will be me. 
Alright. Ya...Let's go! 
来啊 
Step forth! 
制胜的关键就在于找到敌人的弱点 
The true path to victory is to find 
your opponent's weakness. 
然后狠狠打击 
And make him suffer for it. 
耶! 
借力打力 
Oh yeah. To take his strength 
and use it against him. 
直到他倒下或是认输 
Until he finally falls or quits. 
但真正的勇士是不会认输的 
But a real warrior never quits. 
Don't worry Master, I'll never quit. 
别担心 师父 我不会认输的 
他要是聪明的话 就不会再爬上来了 
If he is smart he won't 
come back those steps. 
但他会再来的 
But he will. 
He's not going to quit, is he? 
他不会放弃的 是吗? 
至少不会放弃弹跳 瞧瞧他! 
He's not going to quit bouncing. 
I'll tell you that. 
你不是说针灸会让我感觉好一点的吗? 
Oouch! I thought you said 
accupuncture will make me feel better. 
确实会 只是不太好找穴位 
Trust me it will. 
It's just not easy finding right nerve points 
特别是在这身... 
肥肉... 
under all this...fat? 
:///C|//（第 28／54 页）[]:///C|//
Fur! 
皮毛 我要说的是皮毛 
I was going to say fur. 
Sure you were. 
当然了 
我怎么会凭体形裁定谁是高手呢? 
看看我.... 
Who am I to judge a warrior 
based on his size? 
So I mean, look at me. 
I'm over here. 
我在这 
Haa...aah... 
Maybe you should take a look at this again. 
也许你该再好好看看这个 
对 好的 
Ohh... Okay. 
Oouch! 
Stop! Stop it! 
别扎了 别扎了 
Eee...ouch! 
我知道师父其实是想启发我 
I know Master Shifu is trying 
to inspire me and all. 
但如果我不了解他的话 
But if I didn't know any better 
I'll say he's trying to get rid of me. 
会以为他是要甩掉我 
师父看上去确实很冷漠 
I know he can seem like heartless. 
Aaahh...! 
但是他以前并不是这样的 
But you know he wasn't 
always like that. 
据说 
According to legend there was once a time 
when Master Shifu actually used to spy... 
师父之前一直是笑容可掬的人 
- 不可能 
- 真的 
No... 
Yes, but that was before... 
- 但是在那件事发生之后 
:///C|//（第 29／54 页）[]:///C|//
- 什么事? 
Before what? 
Before Tai Lung. 
太郎叛乱 
我们不该谈论他 
Aah...ya. 
We are not really suppose to talk about him. 
如果他要待在这里 就应该知道这些 
Well if he is going to stay here 
he should now. 
我知道太郎 
Guys, guys, 
I know about Tai Lung. 
他是师父的一个徒弟 
He was a student. The first to ever 
master the 1000 scrolls of Kung Fu. 
第一个精通上千种武艺的人 
但他变坏了 后来进了监狱 
And then he turned bad 
and now he's in jail. 
他不只是一个普通徒弟 
He wasn't just a student. 
他是个弃婴 师父收留了他 
Shifu found him as a cub. 
把他当作自己的儿子一样养大 
And he raised him as his son. 
当他展现出武学天赋时 
And when the child showed 
talent in Kung Fu 
师父就将武艺传授给了他 
Shifu trained him. 
师父非常器重他 
说他注定会成就非凡 
He believed in him. He told him 
he was destined for greatness. 
太郎永远都不满足 
It was never enough for Tai Lung. 
他渴望得到龙之典 
He wanted the Dragon Scroll. 
但是龟仙人发现了他心中的邪念 
But Oogway saw darkness 
in his heart and refused. 
于是拒绝了 
:///C|//（第 30／54 页）[]:///C|//
爆怒之下 太郎毁坏了村庄 
Outraged, Tai Lung 
laid waste to the Valley. 
企图强夺龙之典 
He tried to take the Scroll by force. 
师父必须亲手毁掉他的心血 
And Shifu has to destroy 
what he had created. 
可又怎么下的了手呢? 
But how could he? 
师父一辈子只爱过太郎一个人 
Shifu loved Tai Lung like he 
has never love anyone before. 
也许以后也不会再爱 
What's it? 
现在是他纠正过往的机会 
And now he has a chance 
to make things right. 
教出一个真正的龙斗士 
To train the true Dragon Warrior. 
却蹦出个你来 
And he is stuck with you. 
一个吊儿郎当的大胖熊猫 
觉得这事好像笑话 
A big fat Panda who 
treats it like a joke. 
你大爷啊! 
等等 我的错 
不小心扎到他的颜面神经了 
Ohh... That's it! 
Wait! My fault! 
I accidentally tweaked his facial nerves. 
心脏说不定也被我扎停了... 
And may have also stopped his heart. 
内心的平静...内心的平静 
Inner peace. 
Inner peace. 
内心的...内...内...内心的平静 
Inner...in...in...in 
inner peace. 
不管是谁弄出这扇翅膀的声音 
Look whoever is making that 
flapping sound quiet down. 
:///C|//（第 31／54 页）[]:///C|//
给我安静下来! 
内心的... 
Inner...Quaaa! 
哦! 平先生 太棒了 
Oh, Zeng, excellent. 
我正想听点好消息 
I could use some good news now. 
Aaahh.... 
大师! 大师! 
嗯? 
Master. Master. 
Hmm... 
我有个...很坏的消息 
I...I..have ...It's a... 
It's a very bad news. 
啊...宗师 只是消息而已 
Aah... Shifu. There's just news. 
No good or bad. 
没有好坏之分 
师父 你的预见没错 
Master, your vision was right. 
太郎从监狱里逃出来了 
Tai Lung has broken out of prison. 
He's on his way. 
正朝这边赶过来 
这的确是一个坏消息 
That is bad news... 
如果你不相信龙斗士能阻止他 
... if you do not believe that 
the Dragon Warrior can stop him. 
那只熊猫?! 
仙人 那头熊猫不是龙斗士 
Panda? Master, that Panda 
is not the Dragon Warrior. 
他根本就不该出现在这里! 
He wasn't even meant to be here. 
It was an accident. 
完全是巧合 
世间无巧合 
There are no accidents. 
是啊 我知道 您已经说过...两次了 
Yes, I know. 
You said that already. 
:///C|//（第 32／54 页）[]:///C|//
- 这也不是巧合 
- 三次!! 
Twice. 
Well, that was no accident either. 
老朋友 如果你不看清控制的幻象 
Thrice. 
My old friend. 
The Panda will never fulfill 
his destiny, nor you, yours. 
熊猫就无法完成他的使命 
同样 你也完成不了你的使命 
Until you let go of the 
illusion of control. 
- 幻象? 
- 没错 
Illusion? 
Yes. 
看看这棵树 宗师 
Look at this tree, Shifu. 
我不可能随便让它开花 
I cannot make it blossom 
when it suits me. 
也不可能让它提前结果 
Nor make it bear 
fruit before it's time. 
但是有些事情我们是可以控制的 
But there are things 
we can control. 
我可以控制果实的坠落的时刻 
I can control when 
the fruit will fall. 
我可以控制它的种子在哪里安家 
I can control where 
to plant the seed. 
这可不是幻象 先人 
That is no illusion, Master. 
没错! 可是无论你做什么 
Ah...yes, but no matter 
what you do 
这个种子最终也还是长成棵桃树 
That seed will grow 
to be a peach tree. 
你或许想要苹果或是橘子 
:///C|//（第 33／54 页）[]:///C|//
You may wish for an 
apple or an orange. 
但到头来还是桃子 
But you will get a peach. 
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung. 
但是桃子不可能击败太郎啊! 
也许可以呢? 
Maybe it can, if you are willing 
to guide it, to nurture it. 
只要你愿意引导它 教育它 相信它 
To believe in it. 
那么我该怎么做呢? 
But how? How? 
I need your help, Master. 
我需要您的帮助 仙人 
你不需要我 你只需要相信 
No, you just need to believe. 
答应我 宗师 
Promise me, Shifu. 
Promise me, you will believe. 
答应我你会相信 
我...我会尽力的 
I... I will try. 
Hmm...Good. 
好的 
我的时辰已到 
My time has come. 
你必须单独一人继续奋战 
You must continue your journey 
without me. 
什么!什么!什么...你要... 
What?...what?...what are you... 
Wait! 
仙人 您不能离开我 
Master. 
You can't leave me. 
你必须要相信 
You must believe. 
仙人! 
Master. 
I'm not scared...yet. 
Sound like fun. He maybe a wolf. 
那可真吓人 
:///C|//（第 34／54 页）[]:///C|//
可能是最吓人的熊猫 
You may be the scariest bandit 
in Harjin Province. 
但只不过是个小气鬼 不给小费 
But you're a lousy tipper. 
Really. 
真的吗? 那你怎么活着出来的? 
So, how did you 
get out of there alive? 
我意思是...我没真的把这话说出来 
I mean I didn't actually said that, 
but I thought it, in my mind. 
在脑袋里随便想想的 
如果他会读心术 肯定得是这表情 
If he could read my mind 
he would have been like...what? 
喜欢吗? 
Order up! 
You like it? 
这味道真是太棒了! 
This is really good. 
你们真应该尝尝我父亲的神秘配方汤 
Now, come on. You should try 
my dad's secret ingredient soup. 
实际上 就他知道神秘配方 
He actually knows the secret ingredient. 
你在瞎说什么 
这个味道真是太棒了 
What are you talking about? 
This is amazing. 
你真是个伟大的厨师! 
Wow...you are really a good cook. 
I wish my mouth was bigger. 
我希望我的嘴能再大一点 
小虎 你真该尝尝这面条 
Tigress, you got to try this. 
Hmm... 
据说龙斗士能几个月不吃饭 
It is said that the Dragon Warrior can 
survive for months at a time on nothing 
靠一片银杏叶的精华 
和宇宙的能量生存 
but the dew of a single Gingko leaf 
:///C|//（第 35／54 页）[]:///C|//
and the energy of the universe. 
我想我的身体还没意识到 
自己就是龙斗士 
I guess my body doesn't know 
it's the Dragon Warrior yet. 
我需要更多的"精华" 
I need lard more than dew 
and the universe juice. 
和宇宙的"液"态能量... 
- 怎么了? 
- 啊! 没什么 师父 
What? 
Oh nothing, Master Shifu. 
Ha...ha...ha...ha! 
除非你立刻减肥500磅 并且刷牙 
You will never be the Dragon Warrior 
unless you lose 500 pounds. 
and brush your teeth. 
What is the noise you're making? 
你永远也成不了龙斗士 
那是什么噪音? 
笑声! 我从来没听过 
Laughter? 
I have never heard of it. 
努力练功 徒儿们 也许有一天 
Work hard Panda and maybe someday 
you'll have ears like mine. 
你们就能长出跟我一样的耳朵 
That's good. 
Oh...oh, yup. 
耳朵 
Ears? 
It's not working for you. 
不好笑吗? 我觉得我学的挺像的 
师父... 
I thought they're pretty good. 
It's Shifu! 
学的就是师傅啊 你们以为我在学谁? 
Of course it's Shifu. 
What do you think I'm doing? 
喔喔喔...师父您来了 
Master Shifu. 
Aahh... 
:///C|//（第 36／54 页）[]:///C|//
你们认为这很好笑吗 
You think this is funny! 
Tai Lung has escaped from prison! 
太郎已经从监狱里逃出来了 
- 你们却还表现的像顽童 
- 什么? 
And you all are acting like children! 
What? 
他来抢龙之典 
He's coming for the Dragon Scroll and 
you're the only one who can stop him. 
你是唯一可以阻止他的人 
我还嘲笑您缺少幽默细胞呢 
Ha...and here I am saying you've 
got no a sense of humour. 
我还是...我不说了... 
I am gonna... step down. 
What? You're serious? 
您是认真的? 而我必须... 
And I have to...aaa...not... 
Master Oogway will stop him. 
龟仙人可以降伏他 
他之前做过一次 
一定也还可以做一次 
He did it before. He'll do it again. 
Oogway cannot! 
龟仙人不能! 再也不能了... 
Not anymore. 
Haa? 
我们唯一的希望就是龙斗士 
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior. 
- 那头熊猫? 
- 没错! 就是那头熊猫 
The Panda? 
Yes, the Panda! 
师父 别这样了 让我们去阻止太郎 
Master please, let us stop Tai Lung? 
This is what you train us for! 
这就是你训练我们的目的所在啊 
不! 击败太郎不是你们的使命 
No! It is not your destiny to defeat 
Tai Lung! It is his! 
是他的使命 
:///C|//（第 37／54 页）[]:///C|//
他去哪里了? 
Where did he go? 
你不准走 
You cannot leave! 
A real warrior never quit! 
真正的勇士是永不放弃的 
看着吧! 
Watch me! 
别闹了 我怎么能对抗太郎 
Come on! How am I suppose 
to beat Tai Lung? 
在这阶梯上我连你都打败不了 
I can't even beat you to the stairs. 
你能对抗他是因为你就是龙斗士 
You will beat him because 
you are the Dragon Warrior. 
你根本不相信的 
你从来就不相信 
Ouch! 
You don't believe that! 
Oh! You never believed that. 
从第一刻起 你就想赶我走 
From the first moment I got here, 
you've been trying to get rid of me. 
没错 我曾经不相信 
Yes, I was! 
但现在 我要你相信你的师父 
But now I ask you to trust in your Master 
as I have come to trust in mine. 
就像我相信我的师父一样 
你不是我的师父 我也不是龙斗士 
You are not my Master. 
And I am not the Dragon Warrior. 
那你怎么不放弃 
Then why didn't you quit? 
You knew I was trying to get rid of you. 
你也知道我一直想赶你走啊 
可你留了下来 
Yet you stayed. 
Ya. I stayed. 
是的 我没走 因为... 
I stayed because every time 
you threw a brick at my head 
:///C|//（第 38／54 页）[]:///C|//
因为你动不动打我头 
或说我很臭 都很伤自尊 
Or said I smelled, it hurt! 
那也没什么 
But it could never hurt more than it 
did everyday in my life just being me. 
我留下 是因为我想如果有人改变我 
可以改变现在的我 那就是你 
I stayed because I thought if anyone 
could change me, could make me not me... 
怎么训练? 怎么训练? 
整个中国最伟大的功夫大师 
...it was you. The greatest 
Kung Fu teacher of all of China. 
我能改变你 我能培养你成为神龙武士 
我会的.... 
But I can change you! I can turn 
you into the Dragon Warrior. And I will! 
拜托 太郎正往这里来 
Come on, Tai Lung is 
on his way right now. 
即使他花费100年到达这里 
你要怎样让我变成龙斗士？ 
And even if it takes him 
a hundred years to get here. 
How are you going to change 
this into the Dragon Warrior? 
Hah? 
怎样？ 
How? 
How? 
- 怎样？ 
- 我不知道 
How? 
I don't know! 
我不知道 
I do not know 
我就说嘛! 
That's what I thought. 
这就是您训练我的目的所在 
This is what she trains for it

别拦我 
Don't try and stop me. 
- 我们不是来拦你的 
- 什么? 
We are not trying to stop you. 
What? 
我们是跟你一起去 
We are coming with you. 
怎么了? 我一不开心就会吃东西 
What? 
I eat when I am upset, okay! 
不用解释 
Oh! No need to explain. 
我还以为你是大猴呢 
I just thought you might be monkey. 
He hides his almond cookies in the top-shelf. 
他把饼干藏在最高的架子上 
别告诉大猴 
Don't tell Monkey. 
看看你 
Look at you. 
Yaaa..! 
我知道 我又打扰到你了 
I know I disgust you. 
No, I mean, how did you get up there? 
不不 我是说 你怎么上去的 
我不知道 我... 
I don't know,...I... 
I don't know. Just get the cookies. 
我不知道 我就是拿饼干的... 
你现在离地面10呎高 
And yet you are 10 feet off the ground 
and have done a perfect split. 
而且还做着个完美的劈山腿 
不 这个... 
No, this? 
This is just an accident! 
只是个...巧合 
世间无巧合 
跟我来 
我知道你想搞神秘 
I know you are trying to be 
all mystical and Kung Fu-ee. 
:///C|//（第 40／54 页）[]:///C|//
不过能说一下 我们去哪吗 
But could you least tell me 
where we are going? 
你带我走了这么久... 
就是来洗澡的啊? 
You drag me all the way 
out here for a bath? 
熊猫 
Panda, we do not wash our pits 
in the pool of sacred tears. 
不要用这一池祭奠之泪洗腋窝 
Uuh?...The pool of... 
这个池子是... 
这里是龟仙人领悟世间平衡之道的地方 
This is where Oogway unraveled 
the mysteries of harmony and focus. 
这里是武学的诞生地 
This is the birth place of Kung Fu. 
- 你想学武吗? 
- 当然 
Do you want to learn Kung Fu? 
那我就是你师父 太好了 
Yes 
Then I am your Master. 
Okay! 
- 别哭 
- 好的 
Don't cry. 
Okay. 
当你专心于功夫 聚精会神时 
When you focus on Kung Fu, 
when you concentrate, you stink. 
反而学不好 
但这可能是我的错 
But perhaps that is my fault. 
I cannot train you the way I trained the Five. 
我不能像训练五侠客一样训练你 
我发现 训练你的方法 就是这个 
I see now that the way to get 
through to you is with this. 
太好了 我正好饿了 
Aah great, cause I am hungry. 
哈哈... 好! 
:///C|//（第 41／54 页）[]:///C|//
Good, when you have been trained 
you may eat. 
训练完成 才可以吃 
我们开始吧 
Let's begin. 
After you, Panda. 
吃吧 熊猫 
Just like that. 
No sit-ups. No, ten-mile hike. 
就这么简单? 
没有啥机关 不用先徒步十里? 
I vowed to train you and you've been 
trained. You are free to eat. 
我发誓要训练你 你也完成了 
可以随便来吃了 
好好吃

Hey! 
I said you are free to eat.

师父 
Master. 
割断绳索 
Cut it! 
龙斗士在哪里? 
你怎么知道 你面对的这位不是呢? 
Where is the Dragon Warrior? 
How do you know you are not looking at her? 
哈哈 你以为我是傻子吗 
You think I'm a fool. 
我知道你不是龙斗士 
I know you are not the Dragon Warrior. 
None of you! 
你们都不是 
:///C|//（第 42／54 页）[]:///C|//
我听说他乘着火球从天而降 
I heard how he fell out of the sky 
on a ball of fire. 
他是一个战士 
But he's a warrior unlike anything 
in the world has ever seen. 
是世间唯一的 
阿波? 
他叫这个名字啊 阿波! 
Po? 
So that is his name. 
Po! 
最终 我们会来一场世纪之战 
Finally, a worthy opponent. 
铸就传奇 世世流传

大猴! 
去吧~ 
Monkey! 
Jump! 
螳螂 
Mantis! 
现在 
Now! 
师父把你们教的不错 
Shifu, taught you well. 
但他没把全部本领教给你们 
But he didn't teach you everything. 
你干的不错 阿波 
You have done well, Panda. 
Done well? 
很棒! 很棒! 我表现棒极了 
Done well! 
I have done awesome! 
我干的超级棒 
真正的英雄 懂得谦逊 
The mark of a true hero is humility. 
不过确实 你干的...超级棒 
But yes, 
you have done, awesome. 
:///C|//（第 43／54 页）[]:///C|//
大家怎么了?! 
Five? 
Fives! 
他们死了吗? 
不! 他们还在呼吸 
They're dead. 
No, they are breathing. 
他们睡着了吗? 
不! 他们还睁着眼 
They're asleep? 
No, their eyes are open. 
我们不是他的对手...被点穴了 
We were no match for 
his nerve attack. 
他比以前更强了 
He has gotten stronger. 
太郎? 更强了? 
Tai Lung? 
Stronger! 
他出招太快了 对不起! 阿波~ 
He's too fast. 
Sorry, Po. 
我以为我们能阻止他 
I thought we could stop him. 
He could have kill you. 
他本来可以杀了你们的 
那为什么没杀呢? 
Why didn't he? 
So you can come back here... 
放你们回来 好让我们害怕 
但..没..用..的 
...and strike fear into our hearts. 
But it won't work. 
有点用...我是说 
有点...我还真蛮怕的 
It might. I mean a little. 
I'm pretty scared. 
You can defeat him, Panda. 
你可以打败他 熊猫 
您开玩笑的吧? 他们都打不赢! 
他们是高手 而我只是一个初学者 
Are you kidding? 
If they can't... They're Five Masters. 
:///C|//（第 44／54 页）[]:///C|//
I'm just one me. 
但有一样东西 只有你才会拥有 
But you have the one thing 
that no one else does, 
你真的相信我准备好了? 
You really believe I'm ready. 
是的! 阿波 
You are, Po. 
看! 龙之典 是你的了 
Behold, the Dragon Scroll. 
It is yours. 
Wait. 
等等...我看了后会怎么样? 
What happens when I read it? 
No one knows. 
没人知道... 
但传说你将能听见蝴蝶的拍翅声 
But legend says you will be able 
to hear a butterfly's wings beat. 
哦? 真的? 
Wow! Really? That's cool. 
Yes! 
酷! 
是的 深处洞穴亦能见光 
宛若宇宙环绕周围 
And see light in the deepest cave. 
You will feel the universe in motion around you. 
哇! 那我能打穿墙壁吗? 
我能连坐四个后空翻吗? 
Wow! Can I punch through walls? 
Can I do a quadruple back flip? 
集中注意力~集中注意力~集中注意力 
Focus. Focus. Focus! 
Oh, ya...yah. 
哦! 好的 好的 
读吧 阿波 完成你的使命 
Read it Po. 
And fulfill your destiny. 
读吧 成为真正的龙斗士 
Read it and become the Dragon Warrior. 
Wow...! 
哇! 
太难打开了 
:///C|//（第 45／54 页）[]:///C|//
It's impossible to open. 
拜托 
谢了 我应该是已经快打开了呢 
Thank you. 
Probably, loosen it up for you. 
咳咳 好了 开始了 
Okay, here goes. 
Aargh...! 
空白的 
It's blank. 
What? 
什么? 
给你看看 
Here, look. 
No, I am forbidden to look upon it. 
不! 我是不能看的 
空白? 我不...我不明白 
Blank! 
I don't...I don't understand. 
好吧 
那是乌龟故弄玄虚喽? 
Okay. So like Oogway was 
just a crazy old turtle after all. 
龟仙人是智者 
No. Oogway was wiser than us all. 
拜托 面对现实吧 
Oh, come on. 
Face it. He picked me by accident. 
它挑上我都是阴错阳差 
我当然不是龙斗士了 开什么玩笑 
Of course I'm not Dragon Warrior. 
Who am I kidding? 
那谁才能阻止太郎? 
But who will stop Tai Lung? 
He will destroy everything. 
他会毁了一切 杀了所有人的 
And everyone. 
No. 
不! 疏散山谷里的人 
你们必须要保护村民不受太郎的伤害 
Evacuate the Valley. 
You must protect the villagers... 
... from Tai Lung's rage. 
:///C|//（第 46／54 页）[]:///C|//
那师父你怎么办? 
我和他打 
What about you, Master? 
什么? 
I will fight him. 
What? 
我会把他拖住 
好让所有人都安全撤离 
I can hold him off long enough 
for everyone to escape. 
师父 他会杀了你的 
But Shifu, he'll kill you. 
那便是我犯错的代价终得偿还 
Then I would have finally 
paid for my mistake. 
徒儿们 从今以后 你们便要独自战斗 
Listen to me, all of you. 
It's time for you to continue 
your journey without me. 
做你们的师父 我很骄傲 
I am very proud to have 
been your master. 
我们必须让大家安全撤离 
We got to get them out safely. 
来吧 小家伙 我们去找妈妈 
Come little one, let's find your Mama. 
小龙 去南边的农田 
Viper, gather the southern farmers. 
Mantis, the north. 
小刀 北边 
小鹤 照明 
Crane, light the way. 
看啊 这不是龙斗士吗 
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior. 
嗨! 老爸 
Hey Dad. 
阿波 
Po! 
你回来太好了 
It's good to have you back son. 
回来真好 
Good to be back. 
Let's go Po. 
:///C|//（第 47／54 页）[]:///C|//
我们走吧 阿波 
是该好好构想我们下一家店了 
用虾和蔬菜佐料 不再切末了 
For our next shop, it's time to face it. 
The future of noodles is diced cut vegetables. 
No longer slices. 
Also, I was thinking... 
我还在想 
说不定这次能给你弄个厨房呢! 
... maybe this time we'll have 
a kitchen you can stand up in. 
怎样 喜欢吗? 
Hmm! 
You like that? 
阿波啊 天不随人愿 
况且这本不是天意 
Po, I'm sorry things didn't work out. 
It just wasn't meant to be. 
阿波啊 别想其它的了 
你的命运在一直都在向你招手 
Po, forget everything else. 
Your destiny still awaits. 
我们是面条家族 
血管里流的可是面汤啊! 
We are noodle-folk. 
Broth runs deep through our veins. 
我可不确定啊...老爸 
I don't know dad. Honestly, 
sometimes I can't believe I'm your son. 
说实话 
有时候我都不敢相信我真是您儿子 
阿波 是时候告诉你了 
我应该早就跟你说的 
Po, I think it's time I told you 
something I should have told you... 
... a long time ago. 
说吧 
Okay. 
我那"神秘配方汤"的神秘配方 
The secret ingredient of 
my secret ingredient soup... 
哦! 
Ohh... 
:///C|//（第 48／54 页）[]:///C|//
The secret ingredient is... 
过来点 食材就是...啥都没有 
Nothing! 
Hah?... 
啊? 
你听见了哦! 啥都没有! 
根本就没有什么神秘配方 
But you heard me. 
Nothing! 
There is no secret ingredient. 
等等 就只是普通的汤? 
你没有加特别的作料进去? 
Wait, wait. 
It's just plain old noodle soup. 
You don't add some kind 
of special sauce or something. 
没必要 认为它特别 它就特别了 
Don't have to. 
To make something special... 
...you just have to believe it is special. 
没有神秘配方? 
There is no secret ingredient. 
I have come home, Master. 
我回家了 师父 
This is no longer your home 
and I am no longer your master. 
这不再是你的家 我也不再是你师父 
Yes, you have a new favourite. 
是啊! 你有新宠了 
So where is this Po? 
那个阿波呢? 在哪? 
是不是被我吓跑了呀? 
Did I scare him off? 
This battle is between you and me. 
这场战斗是我和你之间的 
So that's how it's going to be. 
That is how it must be. 
一定要这样吗 
必须如此 
因为你的懦弱 我在监狱里待了20年 
I rotted in jail for 20 years... 
...because of your weakness! 
:///C|//（第 49／54 页）[]:///C|//
Obeying your master is not weakness! 
我是武学宗师 不是懦夫 
你知道 我才是龙斗士 
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior! 
你一直都知道 
但当乌龟拒绝我的时候 
You always knew. 
But when Oogway said otherwise... 
你做什么了? 你做什么了?! 
What did you do? 
What did you do! 
什么都没做 
你不是注定的龙斗士 这不是我的错 
Nothing! 
You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior. 
That was not my fault! 
Not your fault! 
不是你的错? 那是谁让我梦想破灭? 
是谁让我经受了炼狱式的训练? 
Who failed my every dream? 
Who told we should train 
until my bones cracked? 
是谁决定了我的命运? 
Who denied me my destiny?!! 
从来都不是我能决定的 
It was never my decision to make! 
现在是了 
It is now. 
给我龙之典 我宁愿死 
Give me the Scroll. 
I would rather die! 
我所做的一切 
都是为了让您为我骄傲 
What I ever did, 
I did to make you proud! 
告诉我您有多为我骄傲 师父 
Tell me how proud you are Shifu? 
说啊 告诉我! 
Tell me! 
Tell meeee! 
我一直都为你骄傲 
一如既往 始终为你骄傲 
I...I have always 
:///C|//（第 50／54 页）[]:///C|//
been proud of you. 
From the first moment 
I have been proud of you. 
但就是这份骄傲和自豪 
蒙住了我的双眼 
And it was my pride 
that blinded me. 
因为我太爱你了 却让你走上了邪路 
I love you too much 
to see what you were becoming. 
是我把你变成了现在的样子 
对不起..... 
What I was turning you into. 
I'm... I'm sorry. 
不需要你道歉 我要我的龙之典 
I don't want your apology. 
I want my Scroll. 
什么? 它在哪呢? 
What? 
龙斗士已经带着它走过大半个中原了 
Where is it? 
Dragon Warrior has taken Scroll 
half way across China by now. 
你永远也不会看到龙之典! 永远... 
You will never see 
that Scroll, Tai Lung! 
Never! 
嗨! 
Hey! 
可恨的楼梯啊! 
...Stairs. 
你是谁? 
兄弟 我就是龙斗士 
Who are you? 
Buddy... 
I am the Dragon Warrior. 
你? 他? 他是只熊猫 熊猫! 
你想怎么样 大家伙 吃我啊? 
You? 
Him? 
He's a Panda. 
You're a Panda. 
What are you going to do, Big Guy? 
:///C|//（第 51／54 页）[]:///C|//
别小看我 我有卷轴 
Sit on me. 
现在 我要用这个 
你想要就过来拿啊 
Don't tempt me. 
Now, I'm going to use this. 
You want it. Come get it. 
终于 
Finally. 
龙之典是我的 
That Scroll is mine! 
龙之典给了他力量 
The Scroll has given him power. 
终于 龙之典的力量是我的 
Finally. 
Oh yes. 
The power of the Dragon Scroll 
is mine! 
什么都没有 
没关系的 我第一次看也没领悟 
It's nothing! 
什么? 
It's okay. I didn't get 
it the first time either. 
没有绝密的奥义 
What? 
There is no secret ingredient. 
而是自己 
It's just you. 
停下来! 我怕痒...... 
别! 别! 
Stop it! Ho, ho, ho. 
I'm going to pee. 
Don't...don't...don't. 
Ha...ha...ha... 
你不可能打败我的 
You can't defeat me. 
你是一只又大又肥的熊猫 
You...you're just a big 
fat Panda! 
我不是一只又大又肥的熊猫 
我是独一无二的肥熊猫 
I'm not a big fat Panda. 
:///C|//（第 52／54 页）[]:///C|//
啊! 无极拈花指 
哦! 你知道这个指法? 
I'm the Big Fat Panda! 
你只是在虚张声势而已 
师父不会教你这个的 
The Wushi finger hold? 
Oh, you know this hold. 
是没有! 是我自己领悟的 
You're bluffing. You're bluffing! 
Shifu didn't teach you that! 
No, I figured it out. 
Skedush...! 
哦! 
看哪...龙斗士! 
The Dragon Warrior. 
Ah... look! 
那是我儿子! 
那个又大又可爱的武林高手是我儿子! 
That's my boy! 
The big lovely Kung Fu warrior is my son! 
耶! 
Yes.

Or we are both dead. 
No Master, I didn't die. 
真的? 
I defeated Tai Lung. 
:///C|//（第 53／54 页）[]:///C|//
You did? 
哇! 果真和龟仙人的预言一样 
你的确是龙斗士 
... Wow! 
It is as Oogway foretold. 
You are the Dragon Warrior. 
你给山谷带来了和平 也让我得以平和 
You have brought peace 
to this Valley.

I'm simply at peace. 
Finally.
