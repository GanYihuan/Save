Flour, eggs, sugar, vanilla bean...
Oh! Small twist of lemon.

你有天赋耶！
This is Emile, my brother.
He's easily impressed.
他是大米，我哥哥
很会大惊小怪的
So you can smell ingredients?

This is my dad. He's never impressed.

So, what's wrong
with having highly developed senses?

Now, don't you feel better, Remy?

小米,你是不是觉得光荣呢? 嗯?
你对我们有伟大的贡献
Noble? We're thieves, Dad.
伟大? 我们是小偷耶! 爸!
And what we're stealing is,
let's face it, garbage.
而且我们偷的是, 老实说吧! 垃圾
It isn't stealing if no one wants it.
没有人要的东西就不算偷
If no one wants it,
why are we stealing it?
既然没人要
那我们又为什么要去偷呢?
- 我们能不能不要再争论这些了

Let's just say
we have different points of view.
This much I knew:
至少我知道一点
If you are what you eat,
then I only want to eat the good stuff.
如果吃可以影响身心
那么我只想吃好的
But to my dad...
可是对我爸来说…

爸 既然我们要当小偷
why not steal the good stuff
in the kitchen,
为什么不偷厨房里的好东西呢?
where nothing is poisoned?

and away from the humans.
第二点,别靠近厨房
也别靠近人类
It's dangerous.
会有危险
I know
I'm supposed to hate humans,

but there's something about them.
可是他们有某种能耐
They don't just survive.
They discover, they create.
他们与众不同
他们会发明,会创造
I mean,
just look at what they do with food.
看他们怎样烹调食物你就知道啦
How can I describe it?
我该怎么形容呢?
Good food is like music you can taste,
color you can smell.
美食就象吃得到的音乐
闻得到的颜色
There is excellence all around you.
你随时随地都可以接触到的
You need only be aware to stop
and savor it.

Oh, Gusteau was right.
哦!食神说得对
Oh, mmm, yeah.
哦! 嗯! 对!
Oh, amazing.

but I can be myself around him.
大米很单纯,跟他在一起
我可以做我自己
Why are you walking like that?
你为什么要这样走路啊?
I don't want to constantly
have to wash my paws.
我们不是随时随地都能洗脚的
Did you ever think about how we walk
on the same paws
用在地上爬的脚
再把吃的东西放进嘴巴里?
that we handle food with?
You ever think about
what we put into our mouths?
你有没有想过
我们吃进过多少细菌?
All the time.
我想过啦
When I eat, I don't want to taste
everywhere my paws have been.
我吃的东西
不希望里面有臭脚丫的味道
Well, go ahead.
好,随你便啊
But if Dad sees you walking like that,
he's not going to like it.
不过爸要是看到你这样走路
他不会喜欢的

可是他他他、嗯、嗯呣
But he...
- 客人的反应怎么样？                       .
- 那不是普通客人，她是美食评论家
- What did the customer say?
- It was not a customer. It was a critic.
- 嗯！柯伯？
- 付培美       .
- Ego?
- Solene LeClaire.
- 付培美？她怎么说？
- 她喜欢那道汤           .
- LeClaire? What did she say?
- She likes the soup.
等一下
- Wait.
- What do you mean, "Wait"?
什么等一下?
是你害我惹上这麻烦的
You're the reason I'm in this mess.
嘘嘘!有人在问你的汤
Someone is asking about your soup.
你在跟我玩什么把戏?
What are you playing at?
我嗯!我被开除了吗?
Am I still fired?
- 你不能开除他
- 什么?              .
You can't fire him.
- What?
付培美喜欢,懂吗？
她特地要让你知道
LeClaire likes it, yeah?
She made a point of telling you so.
如果她写说她喜欢那道汤
If she write a review to that effect
却发现你开除了煮汤的厨师...
and find out you fired
the cook responsible...
- 哼！他只是清洁工
- 付培美喜欢他的汤
- He's a garbage boy.
- Who made something she liked.
如果我们不能支持
食神最宝贵的信念
How can we claim to represent
the name of Gusteau
我们怎么有资格代表他呢？
if we don't uphold
his most cherished belief?
你说的是什么信念啊？乐乐小姐？
And what belief is that,
Mademoiselle Tatou?
料理非难事
Anyone can cook.
什么？
也许我刚刚的做法
对新来的清洁工太严苛了一点
Perhaps I have been a bit harsh
on our new garbage boy.
他冒了很大的风险
He has taken a bold risk
我们应该奖赏他
食神就会这么做
and we should reward that,
as Chef Gusteau would have.
要是他能承担一切后果
If he wishes
to swim in dangerous waters,
我们又又凭什么阻止他？
who are we to deny him?
喂！喂！
你是不是想逃？
- You were escaping?
- Oh, yeah.
哦！对
既然你对他的厨师生涯那么感兴趣
Since you have expressed
such an interest in his cooking career,
他就是你的责任
you shall be responsible for it.
谁还有意见？呣？
Anyone else?
那继续工作
Then back to work.
你这小子要不是很幸运就是很不幸
You are either very lucky
or very unlucky.
你要再煮同样的汤
这一次我会盯死你
You will make the soup again,
and this time, I'll be paying attention.
非常严密的盯死你
Very close attention.
他们认为你可以当厨师
可是你知道我是怎么想的吗？小林
They think you might be a cook.
But you know what I think, Linguini?
我认为你是奸诈自不量力的小...
I think you are a sneaky,
overreaching little...
嗯！老鼠！
Rat!
什么？老鼠！别让它逃了
- Rat!
Get the rat.
小林,拿东西困住它
Linguini. Get something to trap it.
抓它、抓它、抓它
老鼠！哦！
It's getting away.
Get it, get it, get it.
- 哦！我现在该怎么办？
- 杀了它                           .
- What should I do now?
- Kill it.
现在？
- Now?
- No, not in the kitchen. Are you mad?
不，不是在厨房，你疯了吗？
Do you know what would happen to us
万一被人知道我们厨房里有老鼠
if anyone knew
we had a rat in our kitchen?
你知道会怎样吗?
They'd close us down.
我们会被勒令停业
我们的名声已经摇摇欲坠了
Our reputation is hanging by a thread
as it is.
把它拿出去，拿远一点
杀了它 把它处理掉，去！
Take it away from here. Far away.
Kill it. Dispose of it. Go!
哇!
Whoa!
啊!
Doh!
你不要这样看着我
不是只有你陷入困境
Don't look at me like that!
You aren't the only one who's trapped.
他们现在要我再煮一次
They expect me to cook it again!
我是说，我没有野心
我并不想作菜
I mean, I'm not ambitious.
I wasn't trying to cook.
我只是不想惹麻烦
I was just trying to stay out of trouble.
是你在汤里加了那些香料的
You're the one who was getting fancy
with the spices!
你到底加了什么？奥瑞冈叶？
不是？什么？嗯！迷迭香？
What did you throw in there? Oregano?
No? What? Rosemary?
那是一种香料，对吧？迷迭香？
That's a spice, isn't it? Rosemary?
你没有在汤里加迷迭香?
You didn't throw rosemary in there?
那么你洒的那些，丢的那些
天哪！
Then what was all the flipping
and all the throwing the...
我需要这工作，我失去太多了
I need this job. I've lost so many.
我不会做菜
现在我居然跟一只老鼠说话
I don't know how to cook, and now
I'm actually talking to a rat as if you...
好象你…嗯！你点头吗？
Did you nod?
你、你是不是在点头？
Have you been nodding?
你听的懂我的话？
You understand me?
那么我没有发疯！
So I'm not crazy!
等一下，等一下
Wait a second, wait a second.
我不会做菜，是不是？
I can't cook, can I?
可是你...
But you...
你会，对不对？
You can, right?
你不必谦虚，你是老鼠
Look, don't be so modest.
You're a rat, for Pete's sake.
不管你刚做了什么， 他们喜欢
Whatever you did, they liked it.
对，可能行得通
Yeah. This could work.
他们喜欢那道汤
啊！
Hey, they liked the soup!
他们喜欢那道汤
你想你能不能再做一次?
They liked the soup.
Do you think you could do it again?
好吧！我现在放你出来啰！
Okay, I'm going to let you out now.
可是我们要互相帮忙
对吧?
But we're together on this. Right?
好吧
Okay.
我的天啦！
再等一下…
就、就好了
好了就、就是这里
So this is it.
我是说，这里不怎么样
I mean, it's not much, but it's,
you know...
可是它…你知道很不怎么样
Not much.
但也还好
It could be worse.
有暖气有灯、沙发和电视
There's heat and light
and a couch with a TV.
总之，我的就是你的
So, you know, what's mine is yours.
你这…
Are you...
我是在…做梦吗？
Is this a dream?
是最美好的梦
The best kind of dream.
我们俩共有的梦
One we can share.
为什么要在此时？
But why here?
此地？
Why now?
为什么不在此时？
Why not here?
为什么不在此地
Why not now?
有哪里比巴黎更适合做梦
What better place to dream
than in Paris?
早安小厨师，太阳晒…
Morning, Little Chef. Rise and...
哦！糟了
Oh, no.
白痴，我就知道会这样
Idiot! I knew this would happen!
我让一支老鼠到家里来
还告诉它我的就是他的
I let a rat into my place
and tell him what's mine is his!
蛋不见了
Eggs, gone!
笨蛋，它偷了食物离开了
我是怎么想的？
Stupid! He's stolen food
and hit the road! What did I expect?
都怪我居然信任一支老…
That's what I get for trusting a...
嗯！嗯！看…那是给我的吗?
Hi. Is that for me?
Mmm!
嗯!
好吃，你里面加了什么?
That's good. What did you put in this?
那是哪来的啊？
Where'd you get that?
听着，蛋很好吃，但是别偷东西
我会买些香料回来，好吗？
Look, it's delicious. But don't steal.
I'll buy some spices, okay?
糟了，我们要迟到了
我第一天上班
Oh, no. We're going to be late.
And on the first day!
走吧！小厨师
Come on, Little Chef!
虽然我和其他评论家
"Though I, like many other critic,
在食神死后，就把食神餐厅降级
"had written off Gusteau as irrelevant
since the great chef's death,
但是，那道汤却是个惊喜
香味十足又精致的味觉之旅
"the soup was a revelation.
A spicy yet subtle taste experience."
- 付培美说的?
- 对！付培美 .
- Solene LeClaire?
- Yes!
出呼意料的
食神餐厅再次吸引我们的注意
"Against all odds,
Gusteau's has recaptured our attention.
只有时间能证明他们值不值得
"Only time will tell if they deserve it."
好吧，嗯
Well...
你知道
You know.
我知道这点子又蠢又怪
可是我们没有办法单独把汤做好
Look, I know it's stupid and weird,
but neither of us can do this alone,
所以我们必须合作对不对？
你同意吗？
so we got to do it together, right?
You with me?
那我们就开始吧？
So let's do this thing!
嗨！
I...
欢迎来到地狱
现在，给我重现那锅汤
Welcome to hell.
Now, recreate the soup.
要花多少时间都可以
一个礼拜也行
Take as much time as you need.
All week if you must.
汤！
Soup.
噢!你这小...
You little...
噢!
Ow!
你这小不要再…
You son of a...
不要再…
You got...
这个办法行不通的，小厨师
This is not going to work, Little Chef!
再这样下去我会变神经病
I'm going to lose it
if we do this anymore.
我们，我们必须想别的办法
We've got to figure out something else.
让你不会又啃又咬
Something that doesn't involve
any biting, or nipping,
还用你的小腿不停的
在我的身上跑上跑下
or running up and down my body
with your little rat feet.
啃咬，不行
跑来跑去，不行
The biting! No! Scampering! No!
不准你跑上跑下
懂不懂啊小厨师
No scampering or scurrying.
Understand, Little Chef?
小厨师？
Little Chef?
哦！你饿了
Oh, you're hungry.
好吧！让我们好好想想
Okay. So let's think this out.
你懂烹饪，可是我…
有人类的…
You know how to cook,
and I know how to appear
外表
human.
我们只是得想一个办法子
让我可以照你的话做
We need to work out a system
so that I do what you want
又不会显得我
被一支小老鼠厨师控制
in a way that doesn't look like
I'm being controlled by a tiny rat chef.
哦！我在说什么？
我疯了 我疯了 我疯了
Would you listen to me? I'm insane!
I'm insane! I'm insane!
在冷冻库里跟老鼠谈论
怎么样在美食餐厅作菜
In a refrigerator talking to a rat
about cooking in a gourmet restaurant.
- 我不可能成功
- 小林?              .
- I will never pull this off!
- Linguini?
我们必须沟通
We gotta communicate.
我不能老是在做菜的时候
查看你是点头或者是摇头
I can't be constantly checking
for a yes or no head shake from a...
这样会被人…
老鼠 我看到了
The rat! I saw it!
- 老鼠？                                           .
- 对！对！对！老鼠就在在你旁边
- A rat?
- Yes, a rat. Right next to you.
你进来这里做什么？
What are you doing in here?
我！我只是！嗯
想要熟悉一下这些蔬菜还有什么的
I'm just familiarizing myself with,
you know, the vegetables and such.
出去
Get out.
跟蔬菜太过亲近会发疯的
知道吗？
One can get too familiar
with vegetables, you know!
刚刚好险啊！你在上面还好吗?
That was close. Are you okay up there?
哇!
Whoa!
告诉我你是怎么做的啊?
How did you do that?
好奇怪的反应！
That's strangely involuntary!
从第一眼看到你 我就知道
我们的想法都超high的
One look and I knew
we had the same crazy idea.
好了
Okay.
啥?
Huh?
你、你要带我去哪？
等一下
Where are you taking me? Wait.
哇
Whoa!
慢点，抱歉
Wait. I'm sorry.
哇
Whoa!
好了
Okay.
嗯 哼...
Mmm-hmm...
Okay.
好
哇 噢
Whoa!
意大利面
哇 噢
Whoa!
祝我们成功
?votre sant?
对不起
All right.
你搞定了
That should do it.
嗯
Mmm.
恭喜你了
你复制了那道不小心成功的汤
Congratulations. You were able to
repeat your accidental success.
可是要在我的厨房生存下去
不能只靠一道汤，小子
But you'll need to know more than soup
if you are to survive in my kitchen, boy.
乐乐会负责教你
我们这里做事的方法跟规矩
Colette will be responsible for
teaching you how we do things here.
听我说，我只是想让你知道
Listen, I just want you to know
我有多么荣幸，能够向你这么
how honored I am
to be studying under such...
不，你听着我只想让你知道
你应付的是什么人
No! You listen. I just want you to know
exactly who you are dealing with.
你在这厨房看到几个女人?
How many women
do you see in this kitchen?
嗯！我嗯！
Well, I...
就我一个，你觉得为什么会这样？
- Only me. Why do you think that is?
- Well, I...
因为几个愚蠢的老男人订下规则
Because haute cuisine
is an antiquated hierarchy
建立了高级料理的传统阶级跟制度
built upon rules
written by stupid old men.
这些规则目的…
是不让女人从事厨师这一行
Rules designed to make it impossible
for women to enter this world.
可是我还在
为什么我还在啊？
But still I'm here. How did this happen?
因为嗯！因为你嗯你！
Because, well, because you...
因为我是这个厨房里最强悍的厨师
Because I am the toughest cook
in this kitchen.
我千辛万苦才挣得这个地位
I've worked too hard
for too long to get here
我不会让一个侥幸的清洁工
毁了我的努力
and I am not going to jeopardize it
for some garbage boy who got lucky.
懂吗?
Got it?
懂! 懂!
哇!
Wow!
做的容易，吃得轻松
食神让中国菜
Easy to cook. Easy
to eat. Gusteau makes Chinese food
轻松…上桌
功夫
美食包
Chine-easy.
做的太好了，方斯瓦
- Excellent work, Fran鏾is, as usual.
- It's good, isn't it?
- 跟往常一样
- 很好,对吧? .
我需要你帮我的冰冻食品…
新点子设计海报
I want you to work up something
for my latest frozen food concept.
食神的炸小热狗
Gusteau's Corn Puppies.
它们就象炸热狗但是比较小
就这么小
They're like corn dogs, only smaller.
Bite size.
什么是炸热狗？
What are corn dogs?
廉价的香肠裹面皮去炸
你知道，美式食物
Cheap sausages dipped in batter
and deep fried. You know, American.
你设计一下
Whip something up.
或许让食神穿吊带裤戴哈克汤姆帽
Maybe Gusteau in overalls
and Huckleberry Tom hat.
或是一根玉蜀黍化妆成一支狗
Or as a big ear of corn
in doggie make-up.
是…但是拜托要庄重一点
Yes.
But, please, with dignity.
找我的律师
Get my lawyer!
嗯！好
遗嘱里清楚的记载
Well, the will stipulates
从死亡之日起两年后
that if after a period of two years
from the date of death
如果没有继承人出现
no heir appears,
古斯多的食神餐厅
就交给它的主厨你
Gusteau's business interests
will pass to his sous chef. You.
我知道遗嘱写了些什么
I know what the will stipulates.
我想知道的是这封信
这男孩会不会改变什么事
What I want to know is if this letter...
If this boy changes anything!
看起来不能改变什么
There's not much resemblance.
他们两个看起来一点都不像
他不是食神的儿子
There's no resemblance at all.
He is not Gusteau's son.
食神没有小孩
为什么偏偏这个时候出现
Gusteau had no children,
and what of the timing of all this?
离遗嘱写的截止日期
剩下不到一个月啦
The deadline in the will
expires in less than a month!
突然间一个男孩带着
Suddenly,
some boy arrives with a letter
最近过世母亲的信来到这里
声称食神是他的父亲
from his recently deceased mother
claiming Gusteau is his father?
实在是太可疑了
Highly suspect!
- 这是食神的帽子？
- 对啦！对啦！       .
- This is Gusteau's?
- Yes, yes, yes.
- 嗯！我可以吗？
- 可以，可以       .
- May I?
- Of course.
可是那个孩子不知道
But the boy does not know.
他母亲说没告诉他
也没告诉食神，也拜托我千万别说
She claims she never told him,
or Gusteau, and asks that I not tell.
- 为什么找你？她有什么目的？
- 工作啊！给她儿子                   .
- Why you? What does she want?
- A job for the boy.
- 只要一份工作？
- 没错啦               .
- Only a job?
- Well, yes.
那你有什么好担心的？他在这儿工作
Then what are you worried about?
If he works here,
你就可以盯着他，让我去调查
you'll be able to keep an eye on him
while I do a little digging.
看看他的真实性
Find out how much of this is real.
我需要你采集
那个孩子的DNA样本
I will need you
to collect some DNA samples
或许头发
from the boy. Hair, maybe.
记住我的话
这件事情非常非常的可疑
Mark my words.
The whole thing is highly suspect.
他，他一定知道什么
He knows something.
放心，他是清洁工
我想你应付得了
Relax, he's a garbage boy.
I think you can handle him.
你在做什么？
What are you doing?
啊！我在切菜 我在切菜
I'm cutting vegetables.
I'm cutting vegetables?
不！你在浪费时间和精力
No! You waste energy and time!
你以为作菜很轻松是吗？
像妈咪在厨房？
You think cooking is a cute job,
like Mommy in the kitchen?
妈咪不必面对晚餐颠峰时间
蜂涌而来的点菜单
Well, Mommy never had to face
the dinner rush when the orders
come flooding in,
每样菜都不一样也不简单
不同的烹饪时间
and every dish is different
and none are simple,
and all of the different cooking times,
但是必须同时放到客人的桌子上
热腾腾，完美无瑕
but must arrive on the customer's table
at exactly the same time,
hot and perfect!
分秒必争，你不能当妈咪
Every second counts,
and you cannot be Mommy!
这是什么？
What is this? Keep your station clear!
工作台要保持干净
到了晚餐颠峰时间会怎样？
When the meal rush comes,
what will happen?
脏乱的工作台减慢速度
Messy stations slow things down.
食物出不来，点菜单堆积
大灾难
Food doesn't go, orders pile up.
Disaster.
我这样说你比较好记
I'll make this easy to remember.
工作台保持干净，不然我杀了你
Keep your station clear,
or I will kill you!
你的袖子看起来象是一块抹布
Your sleeves
look like you threw up on them.
手臂和手要靠近身体
象这样，懂吗?
Keep your hands and arms in,
close to the body. Like this. See?
要常常回到这个姿势
Always return to this position.
厨师动作快
锐利餐具、坚硬金属
Cooks move fast. Sharp utensils,
hot metal, keep your arms in.
手臂靠近身体可以减少割伤和烫伤
保持袖子干净
You will minimize cuts and burns
and keep your sleeves clean.
厨师的特征：脏围裙干净袖子
Mark of a chef:
Messy apron, clean sleeves.
我知道食神的技巧
I know the Gusteau style cold.
食神的每一道菜
都会有出人意料的地方
In every dish, Chef Gusteau
always has something unexpected.
我会教你
我记得他所有的食谱
I will show you.
I memorize all his recipe.
- 一定要有出人意料的做法
- 不，遵照食谱                   .
- Always do something unexpected.
- No. Follow the recipe.
- 可是你刚才说…说

It was his job to be unexpected.
It is our job to...

怎么样不用吃也能分辨出好面包?
How do you tell how good bread is
without tasting it?
不必闻,不必看而是听声音
酥脆的声音
Not the smell, not the look,
but the sound of the crust.
你听！哦！
Listen.
悦耳的劈啪声
好吃的面包才有这种声音
Symphony of crackle.
Only great bread sound this way.
要拿到最好的蔬果
就是抢先挑选
The only way to get the best produce
is to have first pick of the day
要头一个挑选只有两个办法

to get first pick.
自己种，或者贿赂种菜的人
Grow it yourself, or bribe a grower.
好了，最好的餐厅最先挑选
Voil? The best restaurant get first pick.
人们都认为精致美食很高尚
所以厨师也一定高尚
People think haute cuisine is snooty.
So chef must also be snooty.

I'll be right back. Where...
好吧！我得要…嗨
Hey, I got to... Hey!
不好意思…
我只是想要借一下…　这个
Don't mind me.
I just need to borrow this real quick.
我想想…这一边
Let's see, over here...
我马上…
I'll be back.
Thank you.
谢谢
嗯！对不起我要…
Excuse me. I'm going to...
嗯！很显然我需要这个
我马上回来
Apparently, I need this. I'll be right...
嘿！我要…拿下那个
I'm going to pick that up.
少许的香料
I got some of that spice.
好
Okay.
- 你在做什么啊?
- 我…我…        .
What are you doing? You're supposed
你应该要做食神那道菜
to be preparing the Gusteau recipe.
我现在正在做啊
This is the recipe.
那道菜没有用到白松露油
The recipe doesn't call
for white truffle oil!
你还用了些…
你在即兴创作
What else have you...
You are improvising?
现在没时间做实验
客人们都在等
This is no time to experiment.
The customer are waiting.
你说得对我应该听你的噢！
You're right. I should listen to you!
- 够了         .
- 什么够了?
- Stop that!
- Stop what?
那再吓我了
不管你在做什么，快停
Freaking me out!
Whatever you are doing, stop it.
- 特制的菜还要多久？
- 来了！                       .
Where is the special order?
- Coming!
- 我以为我们是伙伴
- 我们是伙伴           .
- I thought we were together on this.
- We are together.
- 那你在做什么？           .
- 嗯！这实在很难解释啊
- Then what are you doing?
- It's very hard to explain.
- 好了没有？
- 来拿吧！   .
- The special?
- Come get it!
喔喔喔！我忘了加饔愀什萁
Whoa, whoa.
I forgot the anchovy licorice sauce.
- 你敢拦我？                   .
- 我没有，我没有，我…
- Don't you dare.
- I'm not, I'm not. I'm...
抱歉
Sorry.
小林的菜好了吗？
Is Linguini's dish done yet?
好了,就像我们记忆中的一样糟
端出去了
Ja. It's as bad as we remember.
Just went out.
- 你尝过了吗?                          .
- 有，当然有，在他加料以前
- Did you taste it?
- Ja, of course, before he changed it.
好，什么？
他怎么可以随便加料？
Good. What? How could he change it?
他在菜端出去之前才加上去的
He changed it
as it was going out the door!
哇噢
Ow!
客人喜欢
They love it!
其他客人已经在询问那道菜
询问小林
Other diners are already
asking about it, about Linguini.
还要再加七份特餐
I have seven more orders!
这…太好了
That's wonderful.
我要跟他一样的
I'd like one of those.
特餐二客
Special order!
那是什么
What is that?
特餐三客，特餐，特餐
Special order! Special order!
Special order!
- 敬小林
- 谢谢   .
To Linguini.
- 你真了不起，恭喜恭喜
- 真是太开心了               .
- Congratulations, Mr. Linguini.
- Cheers, ja?
- 多喝酒，小林做菜做得这么好啊
- 做的好啊                                       .
Drink now, there's plenty.
- 对呀
- 对呀
休息一下，小厨师喘口气
Take a break, Little Chef. Get some air.
我们今晚很成功
We really did it tonight.
哈
Dah!
拿到你帽子了
Got your toque!
哦！说正经的
Oh, seriously now.
我很想跟你谈一谈
林葛尼，在我办公室
I'd love to have a little talk with you,
Linguini, in my office.
- 我闯祸了吗
- 闯祸? 不….
- Am I in trouble?
- Trouble? No.
喝点酒聊一聊，就我们两个
A little wine, a friendly chat.
Just us cooks.
清洁工不会再问你的意见了
是吗，乐乐？
The plongeur won't be coming to you
for advice anymore, eh, Colette?
他得到他想要的了
He's gotten all he needs.
让我们来庆祝你今天的成功
Toasting your success, eh, Linguini?
嗯呣，真有你的
Good for you.
哦！我只是恭敬不如从命
其实我不喝酒的
I just took it to be polite.
I don't really drink, you know.
你当然不能喝
要是喝那个我也不喝
Of course you don't.
I wouldn't either if I was drinking that.
可是只有特大号的傻瓜加蠢蛋
But you would have to be an idiot
of elephantine proportions
才不懂得欣赏我这珍藏已久
六一年份的拉图堡红酒
not to appreciate
this '61 Ch鈚eau Latour.
而你林葛尼先生，不是傻瓜
And you, Monsieur Linguini,
are no idiot.
让我们也敬不是蠢蛋的你
Let us toast your non-idiocy.
- 小米！
- 大米？
- Remy!
- Emile?
喔！我真不敢相信你还活着
I can't believe it! You're alive!
我以为我再也看不到你们了
- You made it!
- I thought I'd never see you guys again!
我们以为你被急流冲走了
We figured
you didn't survive the rapids.
你…你在吃什么啊？
And what are you eating?
我也不知道
I don't really know.
它可能曾经用来包什么吧
I think it was
some sort of wrapper once.
什么？不，这里是巴黎
宝贝，我的城市
What? No.
You're in Paris now, baby. My town.
在我的城市
我的哥哥是不可以吃垃圾的喔
No brother of mine eats rejectamenta
in my town.
小米！你在偷东西？
你跟小林说他可以信任你的
Remy! You are stealing?
You told Linguini he could trust you.
喔！他可以，这是给我哥哥的
- And he can. It's for my brother.
- But the boy could lose his job.
可是那孩子会丢了工作
那表示我也会，不会有事的好吗？
Which means I would, too.
It's under control, okay?
- 再来点                           .
- 我不该喝，可是，好吧
- More wine?
- I shouldn't, but... Okay.
对了，你在哪里受训的啊！小林？
So, where did you train, Linguini?
受训？是哦
Train? All right.
你该不会要我相信
这是你第一次作菜吧
Surely you don't expect me to believe
this is your first time cooking?
- 不是       .
- 我就知道
- It's not.
- I knew it!
这是我第 二 三 四 五次
It's my... Second, third, fourth...
Fifth time.
礼拜一是我第一次
Monday was my first time.
可是我之前倒过很多次垃圾
还扫过很多次地
But I've taken out the garbage
lots of times before that...
Yes, yes. Have some more wine.
是是是是喝的不够
告诉我，小林你有什么兴趣
Tell me, Linguini, about your interests.
你喜欢动物吗？
Do you like animals?
什么？动物？哪一种？
What?
Animals? What kind?
哦！一般的狗猫马天竺鼠…
The usual, dogs, cats, horses,
guinea pigs,
老鼠
rats.
我给你带了一样…啊！
I brought you something to...
不不不不…
No, no, no, no!
现在立刻把它吐掉
Spit that out right now!
哦！我一定得教你认识食物
闭上眼睛
现在咬一口
啊！看它的味道
不不不
- 不要一口把它吞下去嘛
- 来不及了                       .
- Don't just work it down!
- Too late.
来，来
嚼它，慢慢嚼，只想着它的味道
Here.
Chew it slowly.
Only think about the taste.
- 嗯？怎么样？
- 呣！不怎样！
- See?
- Not really.
Creamy, salty sweet,
an oaky nuttiness.
奶香，咸咸甜甜
坚果的味道、吃出来了吗？
- You detect that?
- Oh, I'm detecting nuttiness.
- 哦！我吃到了坚果
- 闭上眼睛               .
Close your eyes. Now taste this.
现在吃这个，完全不一样
对吧？
Whole different thing, right?
Sweet, crisp, slight tang on the finish.
甜甜的、脆脆的
最后留下一点腥味
- 没错                       .
- 现在两个加在一起
- Okay.
- Now, try them together.
好
Okay.
- 我觉得我好象吃到了什么
- 嗯哼                                   .
I think I'm getting
a little something there.
- 可能是坚果
- 看吧?          .
- It might be the nuttiness.
- See?
- 可能是腥味
- 对了！       .
- Could be the tang.
- That's it.
现在想象全世界所有美好的味道
Now, imagine every great taste
in the world
有无限的排列组合
being combined
into infinite combinations.
过去没有人尝过的味道
等着我们去发现呢
Tastes that no one has tried yet!
Discoveries to be made!
我觉得…
I think...
- 其实都一样耶
- 算了               .
- You lost me again.
- Yeah.
可是蛮有趣的
But that was interesting.
没吃过这么好吃的垃…
嘿！我们在做什么？
Most interesting garbage I ever...
Hey! What are we doing?
爸不知道你还活着!
Dad doesn't know you're alive yet!
我们得回鼠窝
大伙一定非常高兴
We've got to go to the colony!
Everyone will be thrilled!
- 对，可是
- 什么？   .
- Yeah! But...
- What?
是这样的
我有点事…
Thing is, I kind of have to...
有什么事比家人更重要？
What do you "have to"
more than family?
什么事这么重要？
What's more important here?
我…
Well, I...
去一下应该没关系的
It wouldn't hurt to visit.
- 你有没有养过宠物鼠?
- 没有                            .
- Have you had a pet rat?
- No.
- 你有没有用老鼠做过实验？
- 没有                                       .
- Did you work in a lab with rats?
- No.
那你住的房子是不是非常的脏乱？
Perhaps you lived in squalor
at some point?
没有 没有 没有
Nopety nopety no.
你跟老鼠有关系
你自己心里了
You know something about rats!
You know you do!
奶油龙虾脚加水饺放在一起烤
You know who know do whacka-doo.
Ratta-tatta.
- 嘿！他为什么要这么叫啊?
- 什么？                                .
- Hey! Why do they call it that?
- What?
法式杂菜煲，就像炖菜对吧？
为什么要叫这名字？
Ratatouille. It's like a stew, right?
Why do they call it that?
如果要给食物取名字
If you're going to name a food,
应该要给它取个听起来好吃的名字
you should give it a name
that sounds delicious.
杂菜煲听起来不好吃
光是那个大…锅煮的
Ratatouille doesn't sound delicious.
It sounds like "rat" and "patootie."
大锅菜听起来啊超难吃的
Rat patootie.
Which does not sound delicious.
非常的抱歉
我们的酒已经喝完了
Regrettably we are all out of wine.
我儿子
小米回来了!
My son has returned!
要找人取代你当毒药检查员的位置
简直是…太难了
And finding someone to replace you
for poison checker has been a disaster.
幸好没有任何东西被下毒
可是这一阵子真辛苦
Nothing's been poisoned, thank God,
but it hasn't been easy.
- 没有你真辛苦         .
- 我知道. 对不起爸　
- You didn't make it easy.
- I know. I am sorry, Dad.
唉呀！重要的是你回来了
Well, the important thing
is that you're home.
是啊！
嗯，关于这一点
Yeah, well, about that...
你瘦了，为什么？
You look thin. Why is that?
是食物不够，还是你太挑剔了
A shortage of food,
or a surplus of snobbery?
孤零零的在外面求生存不容易
对吧？
It's tough out there in the big world
all alone, isn't it?
是啊！但是我…
我已经不是小孩子了
Sure, but it's not like I'm a kid anymore.
我可以照顾我自己
- Hey. Hey, boy. What's up?
- I can take care of myself.
我找到一个好住处离这不远
所以我可以常常回来看看啊
I've found a nice spot not far away,
so I'll be able to visit often.
也比不上冷酷的现实
你回来…
Nothing like a cold splash of reality
to make you...
- 看看?                              .
- 我会的，我保证常回来
- Visit?
- I will. I promise. Often.
- 什么？你不留下来？   .
- 不，这没什么大不了的
- You're not staying?
- No. It's not a big deal, Dad. I just...
爸，我只是…
你该不会以为我会永远留下来吧？
You didn't think
I was going to stay forever, did you?
我是说…
小鸟终究要离巢的啊
Eventually,
a bird's got to leave the nest.
我们不是鸟，我们是老鼠
We're not birds. We're rats.
我们不离开我们的窝
我们把它变得更大
We don't leave our nests.
We make them bigger.
- 也许我是不一样的老鼠呢
- 也许你根本不是老鼠       .
- Well, maybe I'm a different kind of rat.
- Maybe you're not a rat at all.
也许这是好事呢
Maybe that's a good thing.
嘿!乐队表演得真不赖哦？
Hey! The band's
really on tonight, huh?
老鼠，我们只会偷，爸…
Rats. All we do is take, Dad.
我厌倦偷窃，我要创造东西
I'm tired of taking.
I want to make things.
我要对这个世界有一点贡献
I want to add something to this world.
- 你说话像人类               .
- 他们不象你说的那么坏
- You're talking like a human.
- Who are not as bad as you say.
- 是吗？你凭什么这么肯定？
- 哦！糗了                               .
- Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?
- Oh, man.
因为我刚好有机会
可以近距离的观察他们
I've been able to
observe them
at a close-ish sort of range.
- 是吗？多近？
- 够近了           .
- Yeah? How close?
- Close enough.
他们其实
其实不象你说的那么坏耶
And they're, you know,
not so bad as you say they are.
跟我来，我要让你看一样东西
Come with me.
I got something I want you to see.
我看我还是留在这里好啦
You know, I'm going to stay here.
对了，你走以前
把地板和工作台清干净
Make sure the floors and countertops
are clean before you lock up.
慢点，你要我…
留下来打扫？
Wait. You want me to stay and clean?
有问题吗？
Is that a problem?
- 嗯！没有                   .
- 好孩子，我们明天见
- No.
- Good boy. See you tomorrow.
到了
We're here.
好好的看仔细,小米
Take a good long look, Remy.
老鼠跟人类太亲近的下场
就是这样
Now, this is what happens
when a rat gets
a little too comfortable around humans.
我们生存的世界属于敌人
The world we live in
belongs to the enemy.
我们必须小心的生活
We must live carefully.
我们照顾自己的族群，小米
We look out for our own kind, Remy.
最后我们能依靠的还是自己人
When all is said and done,
we're all we've got.
- 不     .
- 什么?
- No.
- What?
不！爸　我不相信
你是在告诉我未来的世界…
No. Dad, I don't believe it.
You're telling me that the future is...
只会有更多这种事情？
Can only be more of this?
可是，事实就是这样
你不能改变天性　
This is the way things are.
You can't change nature.
改变是天性？爸
我们能选择要不要改变
Change is nature, Dad.
The part that we can influence.
只要我们…
下定决心
And it starts when we decide.
- 你要去哪？           .
- 不怕困难的走下去
- Where you going?
- With luck, forward.
嘿!
Hey! Yeah.
不要拉了
Stop it.
早安
Good morning.
早安
Good morning.
对了，大厨他请你去喝一杯
So, the chef,
he invited you in for a drink?
这是大事
That's big.
这是大事，他说了什么？
That's big. What did he say?
什么？
What?
你不能告诉我？
What, you can't tell me?
哦!
Oh!
原谅我侵犯了你和大厨之间
深厚的私人关系
Forgive me for intruding on your deep,
personal relationship with the chef.
哦！我知道了
Oh, I see how it is.
你原来是想让我
教你几个料理花招
You get me to teach you
a few kitchen tricks
让老板惊为天人
然后一脚把我踢开啊？
to dazzle the boss
and then you blow past me?
起来啊！你醒醒啊
Wake up. Wake up.
我以为…你不一样
I thought you were different.
我以为你认为我不一样
I thought you thought I was different.
我以为…
I thought...
我没有必要帮你的
I didn't have to help you!
我要是只为自己着想
我根本就不会理你
If I looked out only for myself,
I would have let you drown!
可是…
But...
我希望你成功
我…喜欢你
I wanted you to succeed. I liked you.
我错了
My mistake.
乐乐！嗯嗯，等一下！
乐乐！
Colette. Wait, wait. Colette!
结束了小厨师，我不能再装下去了
It's over, Little Chef.
I can't do it anymore.
乐乐！等一下、等一下
不要骑摩托车…离开
Colette! Wait, wait!
Don't motorcycle away.
乐乐，我不会说话
我也不会做菜
Look, I'm no good with words.
I'm no good with food either.
除…除非有你的帮忙
At least not without your help.
我讨厌虚伪的谦虚
这只是另一种说谎的方式
I hate false modesty.
It's just another way to lie.
- 你有天份                       .
- 不，没有，真的不是我
- You have talent.
- No, but I don't! Really! It's not me.
上回我没听你的话遵照食谱
私自加了额外的食材
When I added that extra ingredient
instead of following the recipe
like you said,
那也不是我，真的
that wasn't me either.
- 你在说什么？                   .
- 我的意思是我不会那么做
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I wouldn't have done that.
我…我…会照食谱做
I would've followed the recipe.
我会遵照你的建议
I would've followed your advice.
我会完全遵照你的建议
I would've followed your advice
to the ends of the earth.
- 因为我爱你的…建议.
- 可是…                        .
- Because I love your advice.
- But...
可是，我…
But I...
不能说啊！
Don't do it.
- 我有个秘密
- 嗯！           .
I have a secret. It's sort of disturbing.
令我困扰的秘密
- 我有老…           .
- 什…什么？你…
- I have a...
- What? You...
- 我有老…酒
- 你有老酒？
- I have a ra...
- You have a rash?
不！不不
我有一个小…嗯
No, no, no. I have this...
This tiny little...
小小的，小…
Little...
小小厨师教我怎么做
A tiny chef
who tells me what to do.
嗯！一个小厨师？
A tiny chef?
是是，它嗯！
Yes. Yes. He's...
- 它在这里       .
- 在你脑袋里？
- He's up here.
- In your brain?
为什么跟你说话这么难？
好吧！我要说了
Why is it so hard to talk to you?
Okay. Here we go.
你激励了我，我要豁出去了
You inspire me. I'm going to risk it all.
我不在乎我看起来
是不是象你见过最愚蠢的疯子
I'm going to risk looking like the
biggest idiot psycho you've ever seen.
我是说你要知道
为什么我学得这么快？
You want to know why
I'm such a fast learner?
你要知道为什么我这么会料理？
You want to know why
I'm such a great cook?
别笑，我现在就给你看
Don't laugh! I'm going to show you!
嗯！不要！不要！
No! No!
- 有事吗？安比特？
- 食神餐厅               .
- What is it, Ambrister?
- Gusteau's.
- 终于要关门了，是吗？
- 不是                               .
- Finally closing, is it?
- No.
- 更多的财务困难？
- 不是…它…它       .
- More financial trouble?
- No, it's...
宣布推出新的微波炉春卷？
Announced a new line
of microwave egg rolls?
什么？什么？你快说啊
What? What? Spit it out.
它…它东山再起，它受欢迎
It's come back. It's popular.
- 我好多年都没有评鉴食神餐厅了
- 是，老爷                                       .
- I haven't reviewed Gusteau's in years.
- No, sir.
我最后一次评鉴
My last review condemned it
- 把它贬为旅游餐厅
- 是                           .
- to the tourist trade.
- Yes, sir.
我说食神终于找到了
他在历史上的定位
I said, "Gusteau has finally
found his rightful place in history
跟另外一位有名的
罐头食品先驱并列
"right alongside
another equally famous chef,
那就是包亚迪
"Monsieur Boyardee."
一针见血
Touch?
之后我就没再理它
那是我最后的评论
That is where I left it.
That was my last word.
- 最后的评论
- 是               .
- The last word.
- Yes.
那么告诉我，安比特
Then tell me, Ambrister,
它怎么会受欢迎？
how could it be popular?
不不不不不不不！
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
DNA符合，年纪也符合
一切证明无误
The DNA matches, the timing works,
everything checks out.
他是食神的儿子
He is Gusteau's son.
不不，不可能有这么巧的事情啊
这件事情是陷阱
This can't just happen!
The whole thing is a setup!
那孩子知道啦
The boy knows!
你看看他
装得笨得像白痴
Look at him out there,
pretending to be an idiot.
他在玩弄我
就像猫玩弄着一种…某种东西
He's toying with my mind
like a cat with a ball of... Something.
- 线？
- 是…
- String?
- Yes! Playing dumb.
- 装傻，用那支老鼠捉弄我
- 老鼠？                               .
- Taunting me with that rat.
- Rat?
是，他跟它作伴
Yes. He's consorting with it.
故意要让我以为那支老鼠很重要
Deliberately trying to make me think
it's important.
- 老鼠   .
- 说对了
- The rat.
- Exactly!
那支老鼠重要吗？
Is the rat important?
当然不重要
他只是要让我以为他很重要
Of course not!
He just wants me to think that it is.
哦！我知道他这样做的目的
Oh, I see the theatricality of it.
那孩子第一天上班
出现一支老鼠，我叫他杀了它
A rat appears on the boy's first night,
I order him to kill it.
现在他要我到处看见那支老鼠
And now he wants me
to see it everywhere.
呜!
Ooh!
唔，它在这里
不不不不，它在这里！
It's here! No, it isn't, it's here!
我是不是眼花了？是不是发疯了？
它是幽灵还是真的？
Am I seeing things, am I crazy?
Is there a phantom rat or is there not?
哦…不！
But, oh, no!
我才不会那么容易上他的当
被卷入…他的
I refuse to be sucked into
his little game of...
我该为这种情况感到忧心吗？
我是说…你？
Should I be concerned about this?
About you?
哦?
Huh?
我不能开除他，他越来越出名
I can't fire him. He's getting attention.
我要是现在开除他
大家会问我为什么
If I fire him now,
everyone will wonder why.
我最不愿意的就是人们关心这件事
And the last thing I want
is people looking into this.
你有什么好担心的？
What are you so worried about?
受到媒体注意不是很好？
Isn't it good to have the press?
让食神餐厅上头条不是很好吗？
Isn't it good to have Gusteau's name
getting headlines?
登的是他的脸就不好
Not if they're over his face!
食神餐厅有一张脸
胖胖、可爱、熟悉的脸
Gusteau's already has a face,
and it's fat and lovable and familiar.
这张脸能卖卷饼
很多很多的卷饼
And it sells burritos!
Millions and millions of burritos!
再三天就是截止日
The deadline passes in three days.
然后他不再有利用价值
你就可以开除他
Then you can fire him
whenever he ceases to be valuable
没有人会知道
and no one will ever know.
我担心你给我的头发样本
I was worried
about the hair sample you gave me.
- 我不得不把它们寄回实验室
- 为什么?                                 .
- I had to send them back to the lab.
- Why?
因为第一次的化验结果是
啮齿动物的毛
Because the first time it came back
identified as rodent hair.
- 不,不,不     .
- 什…什么？
- No, no, no.
- LINGUINl: What?
试试这个，这个比较好
Try this. It's better.
- 上来吧           .
- 因…因为你…
Well, because you...
Whoa!
哦！我的天啊！
老鼠!
Rat!
恶心的小东西
Disgusting little creatures.
这再次提醒我
我的世界是多么的脆弱
I was reminded
how fragile it all was.
人类是如何看待我的
How the world really saw me.
而且好戏还在后头呢
And it just kept getting better.
小米！噗嘶噗嘶噗嘶
Remy!
Psst! Psst!
嘿！嘿！我的老弟啊
Hey, hey, hey, little brother!
- 我们正担心你不会，就是
- 不会出现                           .
We were afraid you weren't going to,
you know, show up.
嘿！小米你好吗？
- Hey, Remy! How you doing?
- You told them?
- 小米，你好               .
- 你把它们都带来了？
拜托
我不是叫你不要说的吗？大米
Emile,
that's exactly what I said not to do!
可是你认识他们啊！
他们是朋友
But you know these guys.
They're my friends.
你没说别带他们来
I didn't think you meant them.
好吧！我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry.
别跟我说抱歉，去跟他们说抱歉
Don't tell me you're sorry,
tell them you're sorry.
- 嗯！嗯！你们有问题吗？
- 不，当然没有问题           .
- Is there a problem over here?
- No, there is not.
请在这等
Wait here.
锁住了？
It's locked?
嗯…
Hmm...
小米，你来这里做什么？
Remy, what are you doing in here?
是！大米他带来了一群朋友…
Okay. Emile shows up with...
我说了不可以，我告诉他…
他还是说了…
Okay, I said not to. I told him...
He goes and blabs to...
对！非常糟糕
Yeah, it's a disaster.
总之他们饿了
食物冷藏库也锁住了，我需要钥匙
Anyway, they're hungry, the food safe
is locked and I need the key.
他们要你偷食物？
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's...
是…不…这…
- They want you to steal food?
- Yes. No! It's...
哦！这很复杂，他们是我家人
他们没有你的理想
It's complicated. It's family.
They don't have your ideals.
理想？爱现厨师要是有理想
Ideals?
If Chef Fancy Pants had any ideals,
你想我会在这里卖烤肉吗？
you think I'd be hawking barbecue
over here?
或是微波炉卷饼？
Or microwave burritos?
或塞…我说塞牙缝炸鸡？
Or, Tooth, I say,
Tooth Pick'n Chicken?
跟炸热狗一样的美式食物
About as French as a corn dog!
即将推出
Coming soon!
哈！我们正在发明新的促销方法
We're inventing new ways
to sell out over here.
你要不要吃羊肉杂碎布丁？
Will ye be wanting some haggis bites?
他们要怎么使用我的肖像
我管不着　我死了
I cannot control
how they use my image, Remy.
你们闭嘴好吗？
- I am dead!
- Can you guys shut up?
我得思考，消息走漏了
要是不能让他们保密
I've got to think! Word's getting out.
If I can't keep them quiet,
哦！我整个家族都会张大着嘴
缠着我要呢…
the entire clan's gonna be after me
with their mouths open and...
哦！在这儿呢
Here it is.
嘿！你的遗嘱
Hey. Your will!
哦！这可有趣了
嗯！你介意我…嗯？
- Oh, this is interesting. Mind if I...
- Not at all.
你请便
林葛尼？
Linguini?
小林的资料为什么
会放在你遗嘱的档案里呢？
Why would Linguini be filed
with your will?
这以前是我的办公室
This used to be my office.
他是你儿子？
He's your son?
我有儿子？
- I have a son?
- How could you not know this?
你怎么会不知道呢？
嗯！我是你想像力创造出来的
你不知道，我怎么会知道？
I am a figment of your imagination.
You did not know, how could I?
天啊！
你儿子是这餐厅的合法所有人啊
Well, your son is the rightful owner
of this restaurant!
不！不！老鼠！它…
No! No! The rat!
不！
- 哦！抱歉大厨                   .
- 那老鼠！它偷了我的文件
- Sorry, chef.
- The rat! It's stolen my documents!
- 它要跑掉了
- 嘿！大厨！
- It's getting away!
Hey, Mr. Chef!
怎么回事啊！
你!
You!
- 离开我的办公室                   .
- 这不是你的办公室，是他的
- Get out of my office.
- He's not in your office. You are in his.
- 敬小林   .
- 谢谢大家
Bottoms up, Linguini!
- 你现在是我们的老板了
- 是啊是啊                       .
Cheers, ja.
食神餐厅新任主厨
- 主厨请看这边       .
- 小林大厨请看这边
Chef! Chef!
Chef Linguini!
主厨，你的崛起很快
但你没有受过正式训练
Your rise has been meteoric,
yet you have no formal training.
你厨艺出众的秘诀是什么？
What is the secret to your genius?
秘诀？你…你们想知道真相？
LINGUINl: Secret? You want the truth?
我是…食神的儿子
这大概是天生的吧
I am Gusteau's son.
It's in my blood I guess.
可是你最近才知道你是他的儿子
But you weren't
aware of that fact until very recently.
对
No.
你也因此继承了这个餐厅
And it resulted in
your taking ownership of this restaurant.
你是怎么发现的呢？
How did you find out?
这个…我这一部分的我知道
Well, some part of me just knew.
食神那部分？
The Gusteau part?
噢！
- 你的灵感是来自哪里？
- 嗯！灵感有很多名字   .
- Where do you get your inspiration?
- Inspiration has many names.
- 我的灵感叫乐乐
- 什么！               .
- Mine is named Colette.
- What?
我的牙缝里有东西
Something's stuck in my teeth.
卫生稽查员
Health Inspector.
我要检举有老鼠入侵
I wish to report a rat infestation.
它占据了我的餐…
It's taken over my...
不…是是是食神餐厅
Gusteau's restaurant.
食神餐厅？
Gusteau's, eh?
我可以去一趟，我看看…
第一个空档…再三个月
I can drop by. Let's see.
First opening is three months.
必需现在就查，那是一家高级餐厅
It must happen now!
It's a gourmet restaurant!
先生，我接受你的检举了
如果有人取消，我就让你插队
Monsieur, I have the information.
If someone cancels, I'll slot you in.
可是…可是那老鼠，你必须…
But the rat!
You must...
它偷了…它偷了我的文件
It stole my documents.
营业时间过了
It's past opening time.
一个小时以前就应该结束的
He should have
finished an hour ago.
耶！你好！亲爱的，加入我们
Bonjour, ma ch閞ie.
Join us.
我们正谈到我的灵感来源
We were just talking
about my inspiration.
对！他称那是“他的小厨师”
Yes, he calls it his tiny chef.
不是那个，亲爱的，我是指你
Not that, dearest. I meant you.
- It's him.
- Ego?
Anton Ego!
Is that Ego?
I can't believe it.
- 你是林葛尼先生?
- 你好                     .
- You are Monsieur Linguini?
- Hello.
请你原谅我
中断了你过早的庆祝
Pardon me for interrupting
your premature celebration,
可是我认为应该给你一个机会
but I thought it only fair
to give you a sporting chance
毕竟你才刚加入这个游戏
as you are new to this game.
- 嗯！游戏？
- 是               .
- Game?
- Yes.
你一直在没有对手的情况下玩游戏
And you've been playing
without an opponent.
想必你已经猜到了
这是违反规定的
Which is, as you may have guessed,
against the rules.
你是评论家柯伯
You're Anton Ego.
对快速窜红的人来说你反应真慢
You're slow
for someone in the fast lane.
对一个喜欢食物的人来说你很瘦
And you're thin
for someone who likes food.
我不只喜欢食物，我爱食物
I don't like food. I love it.
我不爱的食物，我就不屑一顾
If I don't love it, I don't swallow.
明天晚上我会带着高度的期望而来
I will return tomorrow night
with high expectations.
希望你别让我失望才好
Pray you don't disappoint me.
各位，不好意思
可是在法国，现在是晚餐时间
Listen, we hate to be rude,
but we're French, and it's dinnertime.
她的意思是，现在是晚餐时间
我们快来不及了
She meant to say,
"It's dinnertime and we're French."
别那样看着我
Don't give me that look.
你刚刚让我在媒体面前分心
You were distracting me
in front of the press.
你一直不断拉扯我的头发
叫我怎么专心去回答记者们的问题
How am I supposed to concentrate with
you yanking on my hair all the time?
还有一件事
And that's another thing.
现在，不是只有你的意见很重要
Your opinion isn't the only one
that matters here.
你要知道，乐乐也懂得料理
Colette knows how to cook, too,
you know.
噢！好！够了！
All right, that's it!
你休息一下，小厨师
You take a break, Little Chef.
我不是你的傀儡
I'm not your puppet,
你也不是那双操控傀儡的手
and you're not
my puppet-controlling guy!
那老鼠是厨师
The rat is the cook.
你最好在这给我冷静一点，小厨师
You cool off and get your mind right,
Little Chef.
柯伯要来，我必须专心
Ego is coming, and I need to focus!
你…你这个白痴
You stupid...
哇！我还没见过这种情形耶
Wow. I have never seen that before.
对，好像你是他的绒毛伙伴什么的
Yeah, it's like you're his fluffy bunny
or something.
抱歉，小米
I'm sorry, Remy.
我知道来得太多了
I know there are too many guys.
- 我想要限制…
- 你知道吗       .
- I tried to limit...
- You know what?
没关系，我太自私了
It's okay. I've been selfish.
- 你们饿了吗？
- 这还用说？   .
- You guys hungry?
- Are you kidding?
没问题，晚餐我请客
打烊以后我们就开动
All right. Dinner's on me.
We'll go after closing time.
事实上
- In fact...
- Yeah.
叫我爹…带整个家族来
...tell Dad to bring the whole clan.
小厨师！
Little Chef?
哦！真是太棒了，儿子…
做内奸，是吗？难怪吸引你
This is great, Son.
An inside job. I see the appeal.
哦！
Oof!
小厨师
Little Chef?
小厨师
Little Chef?
嗨！小厨师
Hey, Little Chef.
我…我以为你…先回公寓去了
I thought you went back
to the apartment.
当我发现你不在那儿
我…我不知道…我…
Then when you weren't there,
I don't know...
我们不应该丢下事情没有解决
所以…
It didn't seem right to leave things
the way that we did, so...
听着，我不想吵架
Look, I don't want to fight.
我承受很大的…你知道…压力
I've been under a lot of, you know,
pressure.
在短时间里，有很多改变
你知道吗？
A lot has changed
in not very much time, you know?
我突然变成了食神的儿子
I'm suddenly a Gusteau.
我必须有食神的样子
And I got to be a Gusteau or, you know,
要不然…人们会失望的
people will be disappointed.
说也奇怪
It's weird.
我从来没有让任何人失望过
You know, I've never
disappointed anyone before,
因为从来没有人对我有任何期望
because nobody's
ever expected anything of me.
现在之所以有人会对我有所期望
And the only reason
anyone expects anything from me now
那都是…都是因为你
is because of you.
我对你不公平
I haven't been fair to you.
你从没让我失望
我永远都不该忘记这一点
You've never failed me,
and I should never forget that.
你是很好的朋友
You've been a good friend.
最值得尊敬的朋友
实在是不应…
The most honorable friend
a guy could ever ask...
怎么回事？
What is this?
这里发生什么事啦？
What's going on?
阿！
What...
嘿！
Hey...
你…
You're...
你是在偷食物？
为…为什么？
You're stealing food? How could you?
我以为你是我的朋友
我那么的信任你
I thought you were my friend!
I trusted you!
出去，你和你所有的老鼠伙伴
Get out! You and all your rat buddies!
不要再回来了
And don't come back
不然我就像餐厅对付害虫一样
对付你
or I'll treat you the way restaurants
are supposed to treat pests!
你说得对，我在骗谁呢？
You're right, Dad. Who am I kidding?
我们本性难移，我们是老鼠
We are what we are, and we're rats.
好吧，他待会就走了
现在你们知道怎么进去
Well, he'll leave soon,
and now you know how to get in.
尽管偷吧
Steal all you want.
- 你不来吗？   .
- 我没有胃口了
- You're not coming?
- I've lost my appetite.
你决定今晚想吃什么了吗？先生
Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?
是，我想吃你的心
用铁叉叉起来烤
Yes,
I'd like your heart roasted on a spit.
嗯！请进，嗯！请进
Come in!
今天是大日子
你应该跟他们说说话
Today's the big day.
You should say something to them.
- 说…说什么呢？       .
- 你是老板，激励他们
- Like what?
- You are the boss. Inspire them.
请注意
Attention.
请注意，各位
Attention, everyone.
今晚非常重要
Tonight is a big night.
胃口要来
而且他会柯伯大开
Appetite is coming,
and he's going to have a big ego.
喔！我是说…柯伯他要来
那…那评论家
I mean, Ego. He's coming. The critic.
他会吃东西，点菜…
And he's going to order something.
点菜单上的菜
Something from our menu.
我们必须煮出来
除非他点冷盘，像沙拉
And we'll have to cook it,
unless he orders something cold.
就是放不下，对吗？
Just can't leave it alone,
can you?
你不应该在营业时间出现的
不安全
You really shouldn't be here
during restaurant hours. It's not safe.
我饿了
I'm hungry!
我不是非得吃厨房里的食物才行
And I don't need the inside food
to be happy.
但是老弟
秘诀在于不要挑剔…请看
The key, my friend, is to not be picky.
不…等一下
- Observe.
- No, wait!
嗯！哦！不！哦！不不不
我们该怎么办？我…我去找老爸
- Oh, no! No, no! What do we do?
- I'll go get Dad.
也许你自认是厨师
可是你仍旧就只是一支老鼠
You might think you are a chef
but you are still only a rat.
没错，他上次评鉴的时候
拿掉了一颗星
Sure he took away a star
last time he reviewed this place.
没错，那可能害死了食…
喔，我爸
Sure it probably killed... Dad.
- 哦！我们的运气怎么这么差啊！
- 可是我告诉你们一件事               .
- This is very bad juju right here.
- But I'll tell you one thing...
柯伯来了
- Ego is here.
- Ego? He is here?
- 什么       .
- 柯伯来了
柯伯他只不过是我们的另一位客人
下厨吧
Anton Ego is just another customer.
Let's cook!
对！我们…
Yeah! Let's...
开始吧
Okay.
好了，我想到一个简单的安排
So I have in mind
a simple arrangement.
你帮我创造一系列史大厨冷冻食品
You will create for me a new line
of Chef Skinner frozen foods.
而我的回报就是…
不会杀你
And I, in return, will not kill you.
再见了，老鼠
Au revoir, rat!
您知道您今晚想吃什么吗？先生
Do you know
what you would like this evening, sir?
是，我想我知道
Yes, I think I do.
看了许多吹捧
你们新主厨的文章之后
After reading a lot of overheated
puffery about your new cook,
我知道我要什么
you know what I'm craving?
一个不同的概念
A little perspective.
没错
我要新鲜、洁净、料多味美的概念
That's it. I'd like some fresh, clear,
well seasoned perspective.
您能不能推荐一瓶好酒来搭配？
Can you suggest
a good wine to go with that?
- 搭配什么，先生？                   .
- 搭配概念，没有概念，是吗？
- With what, sir?
- Perspective. Fresh out, I take it?
我…嗯
I am...
好吧！既然你没有任何概念
Very well.
Since you're all out of perspective
我想这个城市里其他人也没有了
and no one else
seems to have it in this bloody town,
我跟你打个商量
I'll make you a deal.
你提供食物，我来提供概念
You provide the food,
I'll provide the perspective.
配上一九四七年份的白马堡美酒
刚刚好
Which would go nicely
with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947.
我恐怕，我，嗯！
I'm afraid I...
你要点的菜是…？
Your dinner selection?
告诉你们的小林主厨
他敢给我的东西，我都要
Tell your Chef Linguini that I want
whatever he dares to serve me.
叫他尽管使出他的看家本领
Tell him to hit me with his best shot.
不管他点什么，也请给我来一份
I will have whatever he is having.
小米，我们放弃了
- So, we have given up.
- Why do you say that?
你为什么这么说？
我们被困在行李箱的笼子里
We are in a cage inside the car trunk
等着改行，替别人做冷冻食品
awaiting a future
in frozen food products.
不，受困的是我，我放弃了
No, I'm the one in a cage. I've given up.
你…自由了
You are free.
我能有多自由，决定在你的想像
I am only as free
as you imagine me to be.
你也一样
As you are.
哦！拜托，我不想再虚伪了
我为我的父亲扮演老鼠
Oh, please. I'm sick of pretending.
I pretend to be a rat for my father.
我藉由小林假扮人类
I pretend to be a human
through Linguini.
我假装你存在，好有人跟我说话
I pretend you exist
so I have someone to talk to!
你只会说我知道的事情
You only tell me stuff I already know!
我知道我是谁
我为什么要你来告诉我？
I know who I am!
Why do I need you to tell me?
我为什么需要假装？
Why do I need to pretend?
你并不虚伪
But you don't, Remy.
从来都不会
You never did.
不，我另一个左边
No. My other left!
爸？爸，我在这里
Dad? Dad, I'm in here!
我在行李箱里面，怎么了…？
I'm inside the trunk! What the...
爸！
Dad!
- 嘿！我的老弟
- 大米！           .
- Hey, little brother!
- Emile!
我好爱你们喔！
I love you guys!
你上哪儿去？
Where are you going?
回餐厅去，没有我他们会失败
Back to the restaurant.
They'll fail without me.
- 关你什么事啊？
- 因为我是厨师   .
- Why do you care?
- Because I'm a cook!
菜好了
收拾脏碗盘
小心后面…烫
嘿！小心后面
菜是你做的
It's your recipe.
你现在居然跟我们说
不知道怎么做？
How can you not know
your own recipe?
我只…我，我没有写下来
那只是突然的灵感
I didn't write it down. It just came to me.
那就再让它出现一次吧！
因为我们不能端出这个
Then make it come to you again, ja?
Because we can't serve this!
我点的菜呢？
Where's my order?
不能给他们点别的菜吗？
那些不是我发明的？
Can't we serve something else?
Something I didn't invent?
客人点的是这个
This is what they're ordering.
你不会叫他们点别的
告诉他们卖光了
Make them order something else.
Tell them we're all out.
不可能卖光了，我们才刚营业
We cannot be all out. We just opened.
我有另一个点子
为什么不给客人他们点的菜？
I have another idea.
What if we serve them what they order!
我们做的到
只要告诉我们是怎么做
We will make it.
Just tell us what you did.
我不知道是怎么做
I don't know what I did.
我们必须给客人一个说法
We need to tell
the customers something.
告诉他们…告诉他们…
Then tell them... Tell them...
啊！
嗯！
Huh?
小米！
小米，别去
- Don't do it.
- Remy. Remy.
不！停！
他们会看见你的！小米
Don't! Stop!
They'll see you. Stop.
我们谈的不是我
我们谈的是现在该怎么…嗯！
We're not talking about me.
We're talking about what to do right...
嗯！老鼠！
Rats!
- 老鼠！                    .
- 什么？别让它跑了
- 小米！快
- 不要碰它
- Remy!
- Get my knife.
Don't touch him!
谢谢你回来，小厨师
Thanks for coming back, Little Chef.
我知道这听起来很疯狂
可是…嗯
I know this sounds insane, but...
真相有时候有点疯狂
Well,
the truth sounds insane sometimes.
但它仍旧是真相
But that doesn't mean it's not
嗯！真…真相
the truth.
真相是…
我完全不会做菜
And the truth is, I have no talent at all.
可是这只老鼠
他是这些菜的幕后功臣
But this rat,
he's the one behind these recipes.
他是厨师，真正的厨师
它一直躲在我的帽子底下
He's the cook. The real cook.
He's been hiding under my toque.
都是它在控制我的一举一动
He's been controlling my actions.
因为它，我才能做出
让大家意想不到的菜
He's the reason I can cook the food
that's exciting everyone.
因为它，柯伯才会在那扇门外
The reason Ego is outside that door.
你们把它的天赋误以为是我的
You've been giving me credit
for his gift.
我知道这很难相信，可是…嘿
I know it's a hard thing to believe.
你们不也相信我会做菜，对吗？
But, hey, you believed I could cook,
right?
各位…这方法可行
很疯狂，但是可行
Look, this works.
It's crazy, but it works.
我们可以成为巴黎最好的餐厅
We can be
the greatest restaurant in Paris,
而这只老鼠，这个天才小厨师
可以让我们做到
and this rat, this brilliant Little Chef,
can lead us there.
怎么样？赞成吗?
What do you say? You with me?
料理非难事
爸!
Dad.
爸，我…我不知道该怎么说
Dad, I don't know what to say.
我误会了你的朋友
我也…误会了你
I was wrong about your friend
and about you.
我！我不要你以为我选择做菜
不选择家人
I don't want you to think
I'm choosing this over family.
你们对我都很重要，我无法选择
I can't choose
between two halves of myself.
我说的不是做菜，我说的是勇气
I'm not talking about cooking.
I'm talking about guts.
这对你真的那么重要吗?
This really means that much to you?
我们不是厨师，但我们是家人
We're not cooks, but we are family.
告诉我们怎么做，我们一定会做到
You tell us what to do,
and we'll get it done.
巴黎市区－公共卫生局
第五区卫生稽查员
阻止卫生稽查员
D小队，快，快，快、快
- Stop that health inspector!
- Delta Team, go, go, go, go!
其它的留下来帮小米
The rest of you stay and help Remy.
工作前务必洗手
第三组负责处理鱼
第四组负责烤炉
Team three will be handling fish.
Team four, roasted items.
第五组烤架，第六组酱汁
各就工作岗位快点、快、快
Team five, grill. Team six, sauces.
Get to your stations. Let's go, go, go!
处理食物的员工都必须两脚走路喔
Those handling food
will walk on two legs.
我们需要外场服务生
We need someone to wait tables.
菜上得慢很抱歉
我们今晚人手有点不够
I'm sorry for any dela
In many ways, the work of a critic is easy
就很多方面来说评论家的工作很轻松
We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment
我们冒的风险小却位高权重，人们必须奉上自己和作品供我们评论
We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read.
我们以负面评论见称,因为读写皆饶富趣味
But the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. 可是，我们评论家必须面对一个难堪的事实 :以价值而言, 被评论家批评为平庸之物的同时
我们的评论也许比他更为平庸
But there are times when a critic truly risks something and that is in the discovery and defense of the new.
可是有时候评论家真的得冒险去发现并且捍卫新的事物
The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations
这个世界对待新秀，新的创作 非常苛刻，
The new needs friends
新人及新作需要朋友
Last night, I experienced something new, an extraordinary meal from a singularly unexpected source.
昨晚我有个全新的经验,奇妙的一餐来自令人意想不到的出处
To say that both the meal and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine cooking is a gross understatement.
如果说那一餐和它的创造者挑战了我对精致美食先入为主的观念, 这仍只是轻描淡写的说法
They have rocked me to my core.
他们彻底震撼了我
In the past, I have made no secret of my disdain for Chef Gusteau's famous motto,
"Anyone can cook."
过去我公开对食神古斯多的著名格言“料理非难事”表示不屑
But I realize only now do I truly understand what he meant.
但是我发觉现在我才真正了解他的意思
Not everyone can become a great artist,
并非任何人都能成为伟大的艺术家
but a great artist can come from anywhere.
但是伟大的艺术家可能来自任何地方
It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now cooking at Gusteau's, who is, in this critic's opinion, nothing less than the finest chef in France. 现今在食神餐厅掌厨的天才出身之低微令人难以想像,依在下之见, 他是法国最好的厨师
I will be returning to Gusteau's soon, hungry for more.
我很快会再光顾食神餐厅,满足我的口腹之欲
It was a great night. The happiest of my life.
那是美好的一晚，我生命中最快乐的一夜
