好了 听我整理一下思路
Alright, let me get this straight.

一个头戴歌伎面具的男人
A man in a kabuki mask

带着一队会飞的小机器人袭击了你
attacked you with an army of miniature flying robot.

是微型机器人!
Microbots!

微型机器人
Microbots.

嗯 他通过戴在头部的发射器
Yeah, he was controlling them

以心电感应的方式控制那些机器人
telepathically with a neurocranial transmitter.

也就是说 这位面具先生
So Mr. Kabuki was using

用超能力袭击了你和气球人
ESP to attack you and balloon man.

你那会飞的机器人被盗后 你有报案吗?
Did you file a report when your flying robots was stolen?

没有 我以为它们都被烧毁了
No, I thought they  were all destroyed.

听起来是有点不可思议 不过当时大白也在 告诉他
Look, I know it sounds crazy but Baymax was there too. Tell him.

是的 长官 他说的是事... 实
Yes, officer. He is telling the tru...th.

怎么... 你怎么了?
What the... What's wrong with you?

电量不足
Low battery.

嘿 嘿 尽量坚持到家..
Whoa! Whoa, try to keep it ho..me

我是您的私人健康助手 大白...
I am a health care, your personal Baymax...

孩子 我们还是打电话让你家长来一趟吧
Kid, How about we call your parents and get them down here.

什么?
What?

在这张表上填上姓名电话 然后我们再...
Write your name and number down in this piece of paper, and we can...

we are at school all day, got it?

我们从窗户跳下来
We jump out of window.

不是 声音轻点! 嘘!
No, But be quiet! Shhh!

我们从窗户跳下来
We jump out of window.

你可不能这么回卡斯阿姨
But you can't say things like that on our Aunt Cass.

小宏?
Hiro?

你回来了 亲爱的?
You home, sweetie?

是的!
That's right!

就知道我没听错 嗨!
I thought I heard you. Hi!

嘿 卡斯阿姨
Hey, Aunt Cass.

看看我的小大学生啊
Oh, look at my little college man.

我迫不及待地想听你在学校的一切
Ah! I can't wait to hear all about it.

马上就好咯
Oh! It means its almost ready.

你能安静会儿吗
You be quiet?

好了 来大吃一顿吧
Alright, get ready to have your face melted.

明天就会感觉到这酸爽了  你知道我在说什么吧
We are gonna feel this things tomorrow. You know what I'm saying?

好吧 坐下来都告诉我
Okay, sit down, tell me everything.

情况是这样的 因为我注册得太晚了
The thing is, since I registered so late.

我有很多功课要赶上
I've got a lot of school stuff to catch up on.

什么声音
What was that?

是糯米团
Mochi.

该死的猫
Oh! That darn cat.

就当饯行 吃一盘好吗
Oh! Just take a plate for the road, okay?

#NAME?

阿正走了

是 他应该会
Yeah, He should have.

但发生了一场火灾...
But there is a fire...

现在他去了
Now he's gone.

阿正就在这里
Tadashi is here.

不 虽然大家都说只要有人记得他
No, people keep saying he is not really gone.

他就不是真的消失了
As long as who remember him.

但还是很痛...
Still hurts..

我没有检测出伤口
I seen no evidence of physical injury.

那是另外一种伤痛
It's a different kind of hurt.

你是我的病人 我想帮助你
You are my patient. I would like to help.

这个你治不了
You can't fix this one buddy.

你在做什么
Ah..What are you doing?

我在下载伤心病治疗的数据库

数据库下载完成
Database downloaded.

治疗方法包括 接触朋友 爱人
Treatments include: Contact with friends, and loved ones.

除非它不是意外...
Unless it wasn't a...

蒙面的家伙偷走了我的微型机器人
Ah! Ah! The showcase, the guy in the masked stole my microbots

还纵火销毁痕迹
and set the fire to cover his tracks.

是他害死了阿正
He's responsible for Tadashi.

我们要抓住那家伙
We gotta catch that guy.

它还活着
It's alive, It's alive, It's alive, It's alive!

要想抓住那家伙 就得给你升升级
If we're gonna catch that guy, you need some upgrades.

抓到蒙面人能改善你的情绪吗

当然

来学点儿功夫吧
Let's work on your moves.

这儿也要改进改进
Now let's take care of this.

这是人们兴奋的时候做的事情
It's what people do sometimes when they are excited or pumped up.

嘿 现在你学会了
Hey, now you're getting it.

我会把碰拳加入到我的数据库里面
I will add fist bump to my care giving matrix.

What are you doing out here?

没什么 只是过来散步 平息我的青春期躁动
Nothing! Just stop for a walk. Helps my pubescent mood swings.

#NAME?

大白怎么穿着炭纤维内裤
Ahh! Why is he wearing carbon fiber under pants?

我还会空手道
I also know Karate.

#NAME?
- You guys need to go. - No, don't push us away, Hiro.

我们是为你来的 这也是大白联系我们的原因
We're here for you. That's why Baymax contacted us.

痛失所爱的人 需要朋友和爱人的支持
Those who suffer a lose, requires support from friends and loved ones.

都被追成这样了还管什么红灯
There are no red lights in a car chase!

为什么他要杀我们?
Why is he trying to kill us?

你为什么要杀我们?
Why are you trying to kill us?

因为他是坏人 我们知道的太多了
It's classic villain, we've seen too much!

不要轻易下结论 他不一定要杀我们呢
Let's not jump to conclusions, We don't know he is trying kill us.

小心车
Car!

他真的要杀我们！
He is trying to kill us!

你刚刚把转向灯打开了?
Did you just put your blinker on?

转弯之前一定要开转向灯 这是规定

我们要去哪里?
Where are you going?

欢迎来到米卡莎 法语里前门的意思
Oh, welcome to the Mi Casa. It's French for "front door".

还真不是
It's really not.

笨蛋 一个戴面具的疯子刚刚想要杀了我们
Listen, nitwit! A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us.

我没心情和你胡闹 弗莱德
I'm not in the mood, Fred!

欢迎回家 弗莱德里克少爷
Welcome home, Mr. Frederick.

希斯克里夫 老兄
Heathcliff, my man!

快进来吧伙计们 这里很安全
Come on in guys. We'll be safe in here.

碰拳
Give me some.

弗莱德?
Freddie?

这是你的房子?
This is your house?

我还以为你住桥下呢
I thought you lived under a bridge.

严格意义上来说是我爸妈的房子
Well, technically it belongs to my parents.

他们现在我们家的岛上度假
They are on a vacay in a family island.

要是运气好的话 我们没准也能去
We should totally go sometime. For all luck!

我的个天
You gotta be kidding me.

弗莱德, 不要碰!

要不是刚被一个戴歌舞伎面具的人袭击
If I wasn't just attacked by a guy in a kabuki mask.

这一定是我今天看过的最奇怪的东西
I think this would be the weirdest thing I've seen today.

我所看到的已经超出了我大脑的承受范围
My brain hates my eyes for saying this.

你的体温仍然很低
Your body temperature is still low.

是的 啊哈

啊 就像烤过了一样
Ah! It's toasted.

啊 真是个好机器人
Ahh! Good robot.

你们认得这个符号吗 伙计们
Does that symbol mean  anything to you, guys?

认得 这是个鸟
Yes, it's a bird!

不 那个面具男带着一个有这个符号的东西
No! The guy in the mask was carrying something with this symbol on it.

抓住那个戴面具的男人可以改善小宏的情绪
Apprehending the man in the mask will improve Hiro's emotional state.

抓住他? 我们都不知道他是谁
Apprehend him? We don't even know who he is!

我知道是谁
I have a theory.

屠杀博士?
Dr. Slaughter, MD?

他是身价百万的武器设计师 马尔科姆· 查瑟蒂克
Actually, millionaire weapons designer, Malcolm Chastletick.

消灭者?
The annihilator?

在那面具背后 是企业家 里德·埃克斯沃斯
Behind the mask, industrialists. Reed Exworthy.

冯·迪斯特拉克男爵?  直接说重点!
Baron von De-Struck? Oh, just get to the point!

你们还不明白吗
Don't you guys get it?

那个攻击我们的面具男子 就是
The man in the masked who attacked us, Is none other than...

瞧
Voila!

阿拉斯泰尔·克雷
Alastair Krei.

什么
What?

想想吧 克雷想买你的微型机器人 被你拒绝了
Think about it, Krei wanted your microbots and you said no.

克雷并不是一个遵守规则的人
Rules don't apply to a man like Krei.

不可能 那个人地位太显著了
There's no way! The guy's too high profile.

那戴面具的家伙是谁?
Then who was that guy in the mask?

我不知道 我们对他一无所知
I don't know, we don't know anything about him.

他是AB型血型 胆固醇水平是...
His blood type is AB negative. Cholesterol levels are...

大白 你扫描过他了?
Baymax, you scanned him?

我的程序设计我测定每个人的健康水平
I am programmed to assess everyone's health care needs.

太棒了!
Yes!

我可以用你检测到的数据来找他了
I can use the data from your scan to find him.

你要在旧京山检测所有人
Uh, you'd have to scan everyone in San Fransokyo...

这也许要花上 一辈子的时间?
and that might take, I don't know, forever?

不 不 不 只要换个角度看问题
No! No... No, I just have to look for another angle.

知道了 我可以扫描整个城市
Got it!, I'll scan the whole city at the same time.

只要升级大白的传感器就行
I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.

事实上 要抓住那家伙 你们都需要升级
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy, I need to upgrade all of you.

把谁升级了?
Upgrade who now?

痛失所爱的人 需要获得朋友和爱人的帮助
Those who suffer a lose, requires support from friends and loved ones.

我喜欢事情的走向
Oh wohhooh! Okay! I like where this is heading.

我们打不赢那家伙 我们只是书呆子
We can't go against that guy! We're nerds!

小宏 我们很想帮忙 但是却爱莫能助
Hiro, we want to help, But we're just us.

不
No!

你们潜力无穷
You can be way more.

滨田正是我们最好的朋友
Tadashi Hamada is our best friend.

我们加入你
We're in.

你们能感受到吗
Can you feel it?

你们能感受到吗 属于我们的故事正式开始了
Do you guys can feel these? Our origin story begins.

我们要成为超级英雄了
We are gonna be Superhero!

抬起胳膊
Arms up!

神经传导器一定在他面具里面
The neurotransmitters must be in his mask.

我们拿到面具 他就不能控制那些机器人了
We get the mask, then he can't control the bots.
