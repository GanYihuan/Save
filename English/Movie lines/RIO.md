琳达 我需要帮助 琳达

哇 你们俩还真能聊起来呢
Wow, you're actually communicating.

对 我摇摆尾巴上的羽毛 代表向他自我介绍
Yes, I introduced myself and shook my tail feathers,

逆时针转 表示他占据掌控地位

好好考虑考虑
Just think about it.

天性

才不叫什么天性
about being thrown half way across the room.

我自己能飞

这可不是我策划的
Okay, I had nothing to do with that.

赛尔微欧整晚在这值班的
Sylvio will keep an eye on them all night.

而且 他有珠儿作伴

宠物鸟 你叫我宠物鸟
Pet? Did you just call me a pet?

严正声明 我不是宠物鸟

Incredibly, you rather be with a human

也不愿和同类在一起
than with your own kind.

那个人类
Well, that human

爱护我照顾我整整十五年
has given me love and affection for the past 15 years,

我的同类 见了我才十五秒 就想掐死我
whereas my own kind tries to strangle me after 15 seconds.

就是因为他们 我失去了一切
Yah, it's because of them, I've lost everything.

你不能信任他们
You can't trust them!

你当然能信任人类

当然了 你有最喜欢的鸟吗
Yes, right. Do you have a favorite bird?

显然 蓝金刚鹦鹉是我的菜
Well, obviously I'm a Blue Macaw kind of gal.

有道理 这种鸟非常漂亮
That makes sense. They are very handsome birds.

其实 我更被他们的智慧所吸引
Actually, it's the brains I'm attracted to.

我对鲜艳羽毛的亮丽外表不太感冒
I'm not so impressed by fancy feathers.

我完全明白你的意思
I know exactly, what you mean.

我的最爱是斑点猫头鹰
My favorite bird is the spotted owl.

他们水汪汪 炯炯有神的大眼
I've always been mesmerized by those big,

把我萌翻了
round intelligent eyes.

你说得对 这不是我的错
You're right, It's not my fault.

-这是你的错 -什么
- It's your fault! - What?

就因为你一通长篇鸟论
With your little bird talk,

还有一堆
and that whole...

听着
Well, you know what?

叽叽喳喳 喳喳叽叽[真正意义上的鸟语]
Squawk squawking is squawk-squawk!

I don't understand!

赛尔微欧是业内最厉害的保安
Sylvio is the best guard in the business.

这么说吧
So let me get this straight.

你被一只小白鸟袭击了
You were attacked by a little white bird.

是的 用这个抹布 他像这样捂住我嘴巴
Yes, with this rag he held it to my mouth, like this.

这下完了
We're doomed.

哪里都比不上家里好 哪里都比不上家里好
Okay, there's no place like home, there's no place like home.

我真想回到我的笼子里
How I wish I was back in my cage

有我的小镜子 秋千 还有小铃铛
with my mirror and my swing and my little bell.

-我想我的小铃铛 -嘘 装死
- How I miss my little bell. - Ssshh, play dead.

没关系 琳达随时会找到我们的
But it's okay. Because any minute now, Linda will find us.

是啊 然后她会
Oh great, and then she'll

把咱们换到另一个笼子里 对吧
just stick us behind another set of bars, right?

是啊 不 不是那样
Yes, I mean no!

听着 宠物笼子也许适合你
Look, pet cages might work

但是我不想成为任何人的玩物
for you but I don't want to belong to anyone.

我嘴上好像卡了个东西
Something seems to be lodged in my beak.

你介意吗
Would you mind?

我知道我现在算不上帅
Oh, I know I'm not a pretty birdie.

但我曾经却风光无限
But I used to be quite a looker.

明星是也

灯光 摄影 开始
Lights, camera, action.

我曾有的完美的身材

鸟中独领风骚

并且还很恶毒

我曾拥有一切 电视和女人
I had it all, TV shows, women too.

我很高挑 36厘米高
I was tall. Over 1'foot 2".

然后他们找了一只漂亮鹦鹉顶替我
Then they got a pretty parrot to fill my shoes.

这就是我堕落至此的原因 
That's why I am so evil, why I do what I do.

他曾是超级明星 年轻而有活力
He was a superstar. So young and vital.

他声名远扬 是南美洲的偶像
He's nasty. A Southern American idol.

他现在是恶毒的鸟 谁这么说我

我是有羽毛的尖喙怪物 鸟类终结者
I am a feathery freak with beak, a bird murderer.

你觉得你比我更强 但是我从未听说
You think you're better than me. I've never heard of you.

我很恶毒 我喂你们吃象鼻虫的芝士球
I'm evil. I'll feed your cheese balls with weevils.

我在人们身上拉屎 然后嫁祸给海鸥
I poop on people and I blame it on seagulls.

是它干的
It was him.

他是险恶之鸟 我所向无敌
He's a nasty bird, I'm invincible.

它是可怕的
He's ghastly.

我所向无敌 无人敢洗 
I'm invincible, I'm unwashable, unrinsible.

就像是废弃的学校 我没有准则
Like an abandoned school, I have no principles.

你们巴西的鸟儿
All of you Brazilian birds

所有一千八百万只鸟儿
All 18 million birds.

我来告诉你们我要干什么
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

-喂 -祝你们做个噩梦
- Hey! - Sweet nightmares.

什么啊 这么吓人 一点都不帅
Not cool man. Scary, but not cool!

-你还好吗 -不好
- Hey, are you okay? - No.

我好个头啊
I'm definitely not okay!

-你干什么呢 -逃出这里
- What are you doing? - Getting out of here.

你到底帮不帮我吧
You going to help me, or what?

其实 救生手册上说
Actually our survival guide

我们应该保持镇定 坐等救援才会得救
said to sit and wait, and help will come.

没人会来的
No one is coming!

我们只能靠自己 如果在这等下去 咱俩都得死
We are on our own and if we just sit here, we're going to die!

好 好 好
Yes, yes, yes.

不
No!

奈吉尔 一边去
Nigel, get out of the way!

停停停 为啥不直接打开门呢
Stop, stop. Why don't you just open the door?

你开什么玩笑 
Are you kidding me?

怎么了 很简单的一个插销而已嘛
Why? It's just a standard flip slide ball.

你干什么呢
What are you doing?

-我不会 -什么 你不会什么
- Well I can't... - What? You can't what?

我不会飞
I can't fly!

-你早点说会死啊 -之前也不需要飞啊
- You couldn't tell me before now! - It didn't matter before now.

我鄙视你
I hate you.

-还有什么我需要知道的吗 -有
- There is something else I need to know? - Yes!

我不能飞 我抠嘴[类似于人类抠鼻孔]
I can't fly, I pick my beak

我有时候在鸟池里撒尿
and once in a while I pee in the bird bath.

高兴了
Happy?

那里 他们在那
There, they are!

我们得离开这儿
We got to get out of here!

等等 听我说
Wait. Listen to me.

我虽然不会飞 但是我特别会走 听我的
Flying may not be my thing, but walking is. Follow my lead.

-左右左 左右左[两人三足] -明白
- Inside right, outside left. - Okay, I've got it.

左右左 左右左
Inside, outside, inside, outside.

好啊 好啊 加油
Yes, yes! Come on!

看 我还是双语人才
See, I'm bilingual too.

好极了
This is great!

我和世界上唯一不会飞的鸟绑在一起
I'm chained to the only bird in the world who can't fly!

其实 世界上有四十种鸟类不会飞
Actually, there are 40 species of flightless birds.

-弯腰[英文同鸭子] -不 鸭子会飞
- Duck! - No, Ducks can fly!

我说让你弯腰
No! Duck!

好耶
Oh yes!

好耶
Yes!

冷静点
Calm down!

不 不
Nooo! Nooorrr!

滚开 你们这些肮脏的家禽
Get out of here, you putrid poultry.

-啊 那是啥 -一根木棍
- Oh, what was that? - A stick.

-啊 那个呢 -只是一块石头
- Ahh, and that? - It's just a rock.

-我感觉后背有只蜘蛛 -你有完没完
- Is that a spider on my back? - Will you quit it?

树叶而已 转过去我看看
It's just a leaf. Turn around.

树叶而已
Leaf.

跟你说了
Told you.

来吧 我们得找个安全的地方过夜
Come on, we need to find a safe place to spend the night.

安全 我们在丛林里怎么安全
Safe? Safe! We're in the jungle!

人们说那地方是个丛林的时候
You know when people say it's a jungle out there,

我很确定 他们肯定不觉得那是个好地方
I'm pretty sure they don't mean it as a good thing.

听着 我虽然不想这么说
Look, I hate to break it to you,

但这是我们鸟类天然的栖息地
but this is where our kind naturally lives.

别跟我讲自然的知识 我平时经常看动物世界
Hey, don't talk to me about nature. I watch Animal Planet.

我了解所有的食物链
I know all about the food chain.

你看 我在这儿就是别人的开胃菜
You see, out here I'm just a hors d'oeuvre.

就是一个羽毛春卷而已
Nothing more than a feathery spring roll.

这就是为什么我们要待在树上而不是地面
That is why we stay on the trees and not on the ground.

您先请
After you.

哦 不 我不这么觉得
Oh no, I don't think so.

我觉得我待在人造的地方会好点
I'll feel much more comfortable in something man-made.

那边怎样
How about up there?

我简直不能相信 我得拽着你这笨鸟上去
I can't believe I've to drag your clumsy butt up there.

拽着我 你瞧好吧
Drag me? Watch and learn.

布鲁 等等
Blu! Just wait!

看看谁拽着谁
Who's dragging who's butt now, huh?

好吧 好吧 你赢了
Ha, ha very funny.

你看 谁还需要飞
You see, who needs flying?

鸟 鸟需要飞翔
Birds, birds need flying.

飞翔就意味着 自由
Flying is... freedom

不用依赖任何人
and not having to rely on anyone.

你不希望这样吗
Don't you want that?

我不知道 听起来有点孤独
I don't know. Sounds a little lonely.

睡觉吧
Let's get some sleep.

我还是稍微晚点睡吧
I'm probably going to be up for a little while.

我还在倒时差呢
Because I'm still on Minnesota's time.

晚安
Good night.

晚安 珠儿
Good night Jewel.

晚安 琳达
Good night Linda.

您好 先生 您见过我的鸟了吗
Excuse me, sir. Have you seen my bird?

见过我的鸟吗
Have you seen my bird?

您好 您看见我的鸟了吗
Excuse me, have you seen my bird?

您看见我的鸟了吗
Have you seen my bird?

女士 美国女士
Lady, American lady.

布鲁 布鲁
Blu? Blu?

我知道您的鸟在哪 
I know where your birds are.

是布鲁吗 你确定吗
You found Blu? Are you sure?

是它
It's his.

让我看看
Let me see that.

没错 就是它
You're right.

好的 它在哪
Okay, where is he?

来吧 咱们走 我带你去找它
Come on, let's go. I'll take you to him.

等等 琳达 我们又不认识他
No, no Linda, wait. We don't know this boy.

我们不能相信他
We can't trust him.

我必须相信他
I have to trust him.

我别无选择
I don't have a choice.

你们以为我是脑残吗
Do you think I'm an idiot?

两只鸟 拴在一起 关在笼子里
There were two birds, chained together, in a cage.

你们怎么能看丢了
How could you lose them?

它们比我们聪明 但是别担心
They out smart us boss. But don't worry.

我们会抓到它们的 我有个计划
We'll get them back. I have a plan.

真的啊 你有何高见
Oh great. What are you going to do?

在城里转悠 然后喊着 "鸟儿鸟儿快来这儿"
Wonder in the city, calling "Here birdie-birdie, here birdie!"

你这么说的话 什么计划听起来都够呆的
Well, anything sounds dumb when you say it like that.

我们今晚必须把它们送到机场
We have to get birds to the airport by tonight.

但今天狂欢节 所有的道路都会被封锁的
But it's Carnival. All the roads will be blocked by the parade.

这就是我为什么想要今早送到
That's why I wanted to go this morning!

奈吉尔
Nigel!

这只鸟比你们俩加起来聪明十倍
This bird is ten times smarter than the two of you combined.

它这么聪明 怎么不让它管啊
If he's so smart why don't you put him in charge?

我就是要让它管
I am putting him in charge.

你不说话会死啊
Stop suggesting things!

找到它们 奈吉尔
Go find them, Nigel.

如果我们没法穿过游行人群
Hmm, if we can't get through the parade,

我们要加入到游行中去
we'll have to be in the parade.

-你确定这个能成功 -肯定
- Are you sure it is going to work? - Positive.

我都用公式算好了
Check my map.

那还真是让人放心不少啊 谢谢你
Yes, that's just comforting. Thank you.

听着 只要把这个锁链弄断
Look, let's just get this chain broken.

然后我们就能去找琳达
Right, then we can go find Linda.

不 你去找琳达
No, you can go find Linda.

一旦我们自由了
Once this chain is off,

我要飞回到丛林中去
I'm going back to being free in the jungle.

-成交? -好 成交
- Deal? - Fine, deal.

干得不错啊 天才
Nice try brainiac.

我觉得有什么东西在盯着咱们
I think something is watching us.

哎哟 小心点布鲁 
Oh, be careful Blu.

这些小玩意儿可能会弄死你呢
They might snuggle you to death.

过来吧
Oh, come here.

攻击
Attack!

这里怎么了
What is going on down there?

走 都走开
Go, go, go. Off with you.

宝贝们 我跟你们说了很多遍了
Okay guys, guys. I told you a thousand times.

马内拉 索菲亚 卡玛娜 听我说 正中我眼
Manuela Sofia Kamana, listen to me. Ow! O'yah, right in the eye.

它们多可爱啊 对吧
Oh precious, ain't they?

一共十七个孩子 还有一个没孵出来呢
The kids! Seventeen of them and one on the way.

嘿 帕克 卡洛斯 别玩你们的弟弟
Hey, Paco Carlos stop shaking him.

它们成了我身上漂亮的羽毛
They have given me great feathers.

爸爸需要歇会儿了
Oh, this papa needs a break.

你们小两口要去狂欢节吗
So, you two love birds headed for Carnival?

-不是情侣 -我们只是认识而已
- Wow, love birds? - We're more like acquaintance birds.

其实那都算不上 我们只是拴在一起
And not even that. We're more like 'chained-together' birds.

是的 我是说 哦
Yes, I mean... Ouch!

你的孩子们是怎么了 这么喜欢羽毛
What is it with these kids and the feathers?

我们也不知道 应该去医院查查
We have no idea, we're having them tested.

你能帮我们把这个弄断吗
So, do you think you could help us get this thing off?

你们真幸运 认识我拉斐尔 
Lucky for you, you know Rafael,

你就认识了所有人
and Rafael knows everyone.

又是打眼睛
Ow! Again with the eye!

听着 再闹我就叫你们妈了
Okay, you want me to call your mother!

不要
No!

屡试不爽 它们都很怕她
Works every time. They are scared to death of her.

叫我干什么
Call me for what?

伊娃 我的心肝儿
Eva, my love.

我得带这对情侣去见鲁伊兹
I must take this young couple to see Luiz.

鲁伊兹
Luiz?

你还想骗我
You don't fool me for a second.

你们就是想去偷偷参加狂欢节
You and your amigos just want to sneak off to Carnival.

说到狂欢节
Oh Carnival.

就是在那次神奇的狂欢节
That magical time

我见到了世界上最美丽的鸟儿
when I met the most beautiful bird in the world.

我还记得咱们相遇时
I still remember the song

回荡着的歌声
that was playing when I first laid eyes on you.

高佻而健康 年轻而可爱
'Tall and tanning, young and lovely,'

伊伯尼玛的姑娘缓缓踱步
'the girl from Ipanema goes walking.'

来吧 宝贝 一起唱
Come on baby, sing it.

当她缓缓走过时
'And when she passes'

每个路人都惊呼不已
'Each one she passes goes 'Aah!!!''

就像是天籁之音
Like a river of the sweetest honey.

爱情不光是盲目的 也是让人耳聋的
I guess love is deaf too.

来吧 宝贝
Come here, mmm.

好吧 带它们去见鲁伊兹 但要早点回来
Okay, take them to Luiz, but hurry back.

你真是一个天使
You are an angel.

我会想念你的 我的小芒果
I'll miss you, my juicy little mango.

我也是 我的小木瓜
Oh me too. My pouchy papaya.

帕克 卡洛斯 把你们弟弟放下
Hey! Paco, Carlos! Put your brother down, now!

她竟然放我走了
I can't believe she actually let me go.

鲁伊兹离这儿多远呢
So how far is this Luiz?

不远 乌鸦飞半个小时就到了
Not far, 30 minutes says the crow flies.

那鹦鹉走路去 要多久呢
And how long does the Macaw walks?

俺家亲爱的不会飞呢
Bobo here can't fly.

-它是只鸟啊 -不是所有的鸟都会飞的
- But he's a bird. - Not all birds fly.

-比如鸵鸟 -你又不是鸵鸟
- There are Ostriches... - You're not an Ostrich.

-理论上来说可不一定 -等等
- Well, not technically. - Wait, wait, wait...

朋友们 我想帮你们 但要走着去
My friends, I want to help you, but to walk the whole way,

-根本到不了嘛 -爸爸在哪呢
- It...it can't be done! - Where's daddy...?

爸爸 爸爸
Daddy, daddy!

但是 我们也许能试试别的方法
But hey, we might as well give it a shot.

快走
Let's go, quickly.

别回头 它们能感知恐惧
No, don't back. They sense fear.

敬告 不要喂食野生动物
真是只可爱的猴子
What an adorable monkey.

嘿 我的手表呢
Hey, my watch!

你们好
Hello boys.

看来你们今天收获颇丰啊
Seems like you had a busy day.

什么 这个吗
Oh, what? This?

这些是我们捡的
This is just some stuff we found.

对不对 小子们
Right boys?

我对你们的小玩意不感兴趣
I'm not interested in your nicked knickknacks.

我不喜欢小偷小摸
Your burgle-bobbles bore me.

有这么两只蓝金刚鹦鹉
There are two blue Macaws out there.

我要你的小喽罗们找到它们
And I need your multitude of vice to help me find them.

那我们有什么好处呢
Oh yes, what's in it for us?

问得好
That's a fair question.

咱们来谈谈吧
Let's discuss it.

我很明白你的意思
I certainly see your point.

但是我该怎么做才能报答你呢
But what could I possibly do for you in return?

救救我 救救我
Save me, save me!

这是个办法
Oh, that's a thought.

这样就行了吗
This is enough?

我可不想强迫你做什么
I don't want to feel like I'm cheating you.

我们去找 我们去找 救救我吧
We'll do it, we'll do it. Save me, please.

救救我
Save me!

好的 我同意了 成交
Alright, you twisted my wing. Deal.

那么 还有疑问吗
Now then, any more questions?

没有吗 很好
No? Good!

你们分散去找它们 今晚之前必须找到
You'll spread out and find these Macaws by the end of the day.

不然给你们每人都上堂飞行课
Or it's flying lessons for everyone!

去吧
Go!

去耍你们的猴把戏吧
Go do your monkey business.

我改主意了
I changed my mind.

要不我们搭巴士去吧
Maybe we can find a bus schedule or something.

不会吧 你现在哪能退缩
Come on, you are not going to back out now?

还当着小姑娘的面
Not in front of a lady.

好吧 那好吧 好吧好吧
Okay, yes..., sure.

太好了 就是这种精神
All right, that's the spirit.

你确定你决定要飞了
You sure you're up for this?

反正又不是
I mean it's not like just

直接从山上跳下去呗
we're hurdling ourselves off the mountain or something.

是吧
Right?

其实 我就是这么打算的
Actually that was pretty much my entire plan.

什么
What?

别担心 布鲁 你有飞行基因
Don't worry Blu. It's in your DNA.

那些没羽毛的哥们都能飞
And if our featherless friends can do it,

能有多难
how hard can it be?

救我
Help me!

你看 有意思吧
Fun right?

对 真有意思
Yeah, fun.

你们两个靠近点
Okay, I need you two to get closer.

再近点
Closer.

再近点
Closer.

很好
Nice.

现在 你们相互挽住翅膀
Now, put your wings around each other.

什么
What?

行了吧 兄弟 她又不会咬你
Come on amigos, Not that she's going to bite.

-你会咬他吗 -等着瞧
- Will you? - We'll see.

现在 你扇右翼 你扇左翼
Now, you flap your right wing and you flap your left wing.

一起扇 你们就可以飞了
And together, you fly.

这看起来不符合空气动力学原理
This doesn't seem aerodynamically possible.

你想太多了
You think too much.

你光用脑子想 是飞不起来的
Flying is not what you think up here.

要用心去感受
It's what you feel in here.

当你感受到心中的节奏
And when you feel the rhythm of your heart.

就像跳桑巴
It's like samba.

你就能飞了
You fly.

看看 很简单吧
See, it's easy.

简单吗
Easy?

对你来说简单 
Easy for you to say.

但对我来说 那是非常非常难
Because from here, it look really really hard.

如果你还想见琳达 
Hey, if want to see Linda again,

只有这办法
this is the only way.

-好吧 你说的对 -当然
- Okay, you're right. - Yes, I am.

-为了琳达 -对
- This is for Linda. - Right.

-易如反掌 -易如风掠
- Keep it simple. - Easy breezing.

信自己 抬起脚 慢步向前...  
Trust, lift, drag...

-来吧 飞喽 -等等 
- Oh, come on, let's go! - Wait!

左 右 左 右...
Outside, inside, outside, inside...

加油 布鲁 你能行
Come on Blu, you can do it!

我能行 我能行...
I can do it, I can do it...

我不行!
I can't do it!

不是吧 怎么又这样
Not again!

-我死了吗 -没 我们还活着
- Am I dead? - No, we are still alive!

太不可思议了
This is incredible.

这是我所见过的最美的场景
This is the most beautiful thing I ever seen.

-知道你以前错过了什么吧 -是啊
- See what you've been missing? - Yes.

布鲁 不管怎么说 你也飞了 
Alright Blu, you're flying. Sort of.

虽然不用动翅膀 但你感觉到了吗
Not really, but do you feel it?

是 我感觉到了
Yes, I do feel it.

不 不 布鲁
No, no, Blu!

我的天啊
Mi Caramba!

对不起对不起对不起 
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

我们要死了
We're going to die!

你还是没用心感受 
You did not feel it in here.

你以为
You think?

我们搭车去找鲁伊兹
Let's catch a ride to Luiz.

你们两个快点 过来
Hurry you two, barbos! Barbos!

这儿都是什么人啊
What's to the species here?

快走
Move it!

快点上来 爱情鸟
Come on love birds.

你成功了
You made it.

就让我安全待五分钟不出生入死
I would love to go five minutes without getting killed.

就这么难吗
Is that too much to ask?

对于一只不会飞的鸟来说 那是当然
For a bird who can't fly, oh yeah.

他们开始为嘉年华封锁街道了
They're starting to close off the streets for Carnival.

小子 最好你说得没错 
Better be right, kid,

因为我们快没时间了
because we're running out of time.

这么多人 车肯定开不过去了
Never be able to get my car through this crowd.

别担心 交给我了
Don't worry, I'm on it.

小子 你这摩托车哪儿来的
Hey kid, where did you get this bike?

用你的吉普车换的
I traded it for your jeep.

什么
What?

是啊 这车车况非常好
Yes, it's in great condition.

其实也就还好吧
Well, good condition.

让开 让开
Hey, out of the way!

小心
Look out!

抓紧了
Hold on!

要不是马上就能解开这锁
I'm going to chew my own leg

我现在就把我的腿啃断
if this doesn't come off soon.

放松点 我们找到鲁伊兹了
Relax, we find Luiz,

我们到目的地了
we're right where we want to be.

拉斐 
Hey, Ralfi!

这不是我们的狂欢节之王嘛
If it isn't the king of carnival.

尼可 佩德罗 瞧这一家子
Nico, Pedro! What a family?

鸟兄 你躲哪儿去了 
Where've you been hiding yourself, bird?

我以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

等等 话说回来
Hold up, rewind.

这不是那只笼中之鸟吗
Ain't that the bird from the cage?

我们的爱情课真是立竿见影
I think our love lesson would down smooth.

你进展真快
You work fast.

小宝贝也有鹰钩鼻
Baby got beak.

原来的笼中之鸟 
You was locked up

现在有辣妞相伴
and now you're rolling with a hot wing.

我真想和你一样
I want to be like you.

别这样 不是你们想得那样 
Don't, it's not what you think.

我们只是被拴在一起
We're just chained together.

我没指手画脚
Hey, I'm not judging you.

给俺留点幻想空间
Keep us spastic.

伙计们 我们在找鲁伊兹 
Hey guys, we're looking for Luiz.

你们见过他吗
Have you seen him?

我见过他 但你没见过
Yes, I see him but you didn't.

他刚走 
You just missed him.

他回车库了
He took the trolley back to the garage.

好极了
Oh great.

没事的小宝贝 你可以赶下一趟
Relax baby bird, you can catch the next one.

是时候 进行下一阶段了
It's time to take it to the next level.

这阶段怎么了
What's wrong with this level?

得了吧 这阶段啥都不是
Come on, this ain't the level.

接下来才精彩
Next level is the level.

-你得摇动尾部羽毛 -是啊
- You got to shake your tail feather. - Oh yes.

我们得把这链条取下
We got to get this chain off.

来吧 爱情鸟 你们可是在里约
Come on love birds, you are in Rio.

你们该好好享受 享受生活
You should enjoy it. Live a little.

我们找到他们了
We got them.

欢迎来到天堂
Welcome to paradise.

是派对吗
Some party, huh?

这儿是我见过的最酷的地方
This is the coolest place I've ever seen.

虽然可能有点卫生问题
Despite all the RVS health code violations.

我喜欢你 我都听不懂你说什么
I like you. Nothing you say makes any sense.

大家听好了
Alright everyone listen up.

拉斐从镇外带来些特邀嘉宾
Ralfi has some special guests from out of town.

让我们展现我们的热情
Let's show them some love

因为我想他们不常出来玩
because I don't think they get out very much.

大家把翅膀合起来
Everybody put their wings together

尽情鼓掌吧
and clap them as loud as you can.

鼓掌 鼓掌 尽情鼓掌
Clap them, clap them. I don't care, slap them.

就那样让我飞吧 
Oh yah thats right so let me fly,

像火箭一样
like a rocket then

飞得太高 
Fly so high ,

我得下来吸口氧
where I need to come down for oxygen

因为一旦开始了

你们两个跟我走
You two are coming with me.

做你的猴头梦吧
In your little monkey dreams.

那是吐给你的
That was meant for you.

我们就不能和平共处吗
Come on, can we all get along?

大鼻子 这可不关你的事
This isn't your fight big nose.

你找我朋友麻烦 就是找我麻烦
You mess with my friend, you mess with me!

还有我们
And us!

对 你这小金刚
Yes, little King Kong.

我是来打酱油的
I don't know what's going on here.

鸟猴大战开始 
Birds vs. Monkeys!

干掉他们
Get them!

去死吧 小山民 
Yippee-kay-yay mountain man!

没打到
Miss!

我们得走了
We have to go!

要搭顺风鸟吗
Need a lift?

接招 臭猴子
Take that you, funky monkey.

-谢谢你 -不客气
- Thank you! - Any time!

那正如我所说
That's what I'm talking about.

鸟人 我们胜利了
Bird man, we threw down!

是啊 我们胜利了
Yes, we threw down.

你们这俩家伙就像火和冰
You guys were like fire and ice.

雷鸣和闪电
Thunder and lightning.

嘻和哈
Hip and hop.

芝士和糖末
Cheese and sprinkles.

那是明尼苏达的俗语
It's a Minnesota thing.

你看 都不知道你在说什么
You see, nothing you say makes any sense.

过来 跟我走
Come on, follow me.

怎么搞的
What?

小鸟们应该在这里
But, the birds were here.

对 它们肯定在这 小子
Yeah, sure they were, kid.

我发誓 那些鸟应该在这里
I swear. The birds were right here.

你怎么会知道呢
How do you know?

因为我也是抓鸟人之一
Because I'm the one who took them.

-是你  -我不想伤害任何人
- You? - I didn't want to hurt anybody.

我只想弄点钱
I just needed the money.

费尔南多 我信任你 
Fernando, I trusted you.

我知道但...
I know but...

老兄 那是很棒
Oh man, that's good.

你们好
Hey guys.

你在这儿干什么
What are you doing here?

我只是来看看 
I just wanted to see

有什么可以帮忙的吗
if you have any work for me.

如果你早两小时来
Well, if you were here two hours ago,

就可以帮我们装...
you could have helped us load...

什么 
What?

闭嘴
Shut up!

你们穿得这么漂亮是去嘉年华吗
So, why are you guys dressed for Carnival?

不 我们偷运这些鸟时 
No, no one will know us

就不会被发现了...
when we smuggle these birds...Ouch!

闭嘴
Shut up!

这是我用心 而不是大脑做出的选择

右踢脚 "我才不是你小公主 给我滚开"
