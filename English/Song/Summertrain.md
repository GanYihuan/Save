Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by 
跟我一起坐火车离开吧 看着车窗外呼啸而过的掠影
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky 
远望艳阳 仰望那苍穹的云卷云舒 变幻出人脸模样
We've been awake all night, shattered dreams all around 
我们彻夜未眠 四周飘荡着梦的碎片
Close your sad, sad eyes we will be safe and sound 
合上你布满忧愁的双眼 我们会安然无恙
 
Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by 
跟我一起坐火车离开吧 看着车窗外呼啸而过的掠影
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky 
远望艳阳 仰望那苍穹的云卷云舒 变幻出人脸模样
Daydreaming lightly through the rainAll's forgiven on a summer train 
白日梦轻轻地穿透雨滴 所有的一切都能被谅解 在这夏日的列车上
 
Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by 
跟我一起坐火车离开吧 看着车窗外呼啸而过的掠影
Seems we are a thousand miles away from last night 
似乎我们已和昨夜相距千里
As you sigh in my ear, kiss the rain goodbye 
你在我耳边轻叹 与雨滴吻别
 
Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by 
跟我一起坐火车离开吧 看着车窗外呼啸而过的掠影
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky

Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by 
跟我一起坐火车离开吧 看着车窗外呼啸而过的掠影
Come away with me, it's gonna be all right just breathe 
跟我一起远走高飞吧 清浅呼吸间 一切都会好起来
Come away with me, it's gonna be all right you'll see 
跟我一起远走高飞吧 你会看到 一切都会好起来
 
And the windows are cryin' but this train is flyin' us all through the rain I feel 
而车窗在哭 但是列车载着你我在雨幕中穿梭
And the sky is getting brighter with every mile 
这苍穹 也随着列车的行进而渐渐明亮
And it all seems clear 
一切变得清晰
 
Come with me for a little ride, see the shadows passing by 
跟我一起坐火车离开吧 看着车窗外呼啸而过的掠影
Look at the sun and see the clouds turn to faces in the sky
